Sushi_Yakuza,4,Positive,"The menu of Yakuza is a bit of a lottery, some plates are really good (like most of the sushi rolls) and instead some others are terrible ( the pizza sushi and most of the fried starters). Taking this in consideration, it¬¥s a great option if you feel like sushi and can avoid ordering from the rest of the menu. We even ordered for delivery more than once and the packaging they use is great.",10-Dec-19
Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,1,Negative,Check your bill when you cancel just in case you get an extra charge surprise on it   There are no more words to describe my experience when I was there. Sad and poor experience!! Never return! Never again,23-Aug-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"I had the yuca profiteroles and the veggie burger, by recommendation of the server. It was absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding. I will definitely be back again with friends !",6-Mar-20
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,"A friend recommended this place as one of the best sushi he‚Äôd ever tried so we booked a table and we agree! Everything we tried was delicious. From the saut√©ed edamame with truffle oil to the flambe√©d salmon niguiri. The tuna tartare was one of the best we‚Äôve ever had, so much so that we still talk about it 6 months after visiting. The place itself is very small but they have made good use of the space and made it very comfortable and stylish. ",29-Sep-20

Picalagartos the best Madrid view , the bellas artes terrace lovely but not as good as picalagartos.  Azotea forus is the less impressive  But Adriana is corteous that help a lot  Go imagine Adriana in other location  The chocolate cake was perfect ",6-Jul-20

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"My family and I (myself, my wife, two adult children) were visiting Madrid for a short break. We are all vegetarians so we had done some research and had a list of places to try. By the end of 5 days we had eaten in 9 vegan/vegetarian restaurants (there is so much choice in Madrid, which is great!) and they were all good in terms of the food. However I have to say that Level Bistro was by far and away the best. Everything was just so good; the restaurant itself was modern with simple but elegant decor, the service was exemplary and the quality of the food outstanding, both in terms of taste and presentation. While not the cheapest place to eat, the price was very reasonable given the quality of the experience; I have paid a lot more for less good meals! We all really enjoyed our meal and would certainly recommend Level Bistro to anyone who wants a great vegan/vegetarian meal, superbly presented. Thank you! Next time I am Madrid I will certainly visit again.",28-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"This was hands down the best meal I had whilst being in Madrid!! I‚Äôm veggie not vegan but really enjoyed everything I had. Everything was delicious and I ended up having 3 courses that I hadn‚Äôt planned on! The staff were helpful and I was able to have a half portion for my starter which was just as well as I wouldn‚Äôt have managed a full size one and then a main! The food is wholesome, filling and seriously delicious, I loved the Buddha bowl! The restaurant itself requires reservation and is directly opposite Retiro Park. It is very well worth visiting if in Madrid.",22-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Perfection!!! The food is out of this world! The flavors are perfect!  The restaurant is an experience and it starts with the amazing employees whom are warm, welcoming and very attentive.  Went for my birthday and two months later took my partner for his.  Vegan and non vegan will love!",5-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"My wife is a vegetarian so I was pressured to go to this restaurant . I ordered lasagna and water informed me it was a cold dish, so tried to find something else but here was nothing on menu that looked good --so for first time ever, I turned the ordering over to waiter who ordered (I think) the sampler meal whee the food just kept coming, various courses -all of which were great. he service was outstanding, the decor could use some upgrade, (too drab), I was truly surprised by how good the food was- best meal I have had in a long time ",2-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"A wonderful dining experience. The staff were really knowledgable and friendly and the food was excellent. We are not vegans and were amazed by how tasty the food was. We had a choice of starters chosen by the restaurant and then the burger and the baked mushroom, which was our favourite dish. ",1-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,This restaurant is a must visit when in Madrid. We were blown away by the food and the engaging and friendly staff. Speaking very little Spanish they made the effort to try and explain the dishes to us and their enthusiasm for the food was evident.  Every dish we had came beautifully presented and was bursting with flavour. I would highly recommend the vegetable rolls!,13-Dec-19
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,A fabulous experience .Had the tasting menu-Every dish was tasty and well presented.Asked for the langoustine gyoza instead of the duck-was changed with no problem.The cheese cake is one of a kind!!! To be repeated.,2-Mar-20
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,"An absolutely superb meal. Tasting menu selected at ‚Ç¨25 per person. Magnificent value for money. All good and cooked to perfection and the tastes were out of this world.  Started with Edamames and these beans were delicious. Next was Gyozos with Duck and Ginger with Kimchi sauce. Magic! Next, a Bao with red tuna, teriyaki, marinated onion and quail‚Äôs egg. Gets better and better!  A nigiuri of white fish with ajo negra. Further nigiuri of salmon with melted lim√≥n. Rolls of Langoustines with Avocados. A postre of cheesecake. Bottle of Somontano Gewurtztraminer and Aqua sin Gas. ‚Ç¨74 for 2. In Madrid!!! Strongly recommended!!!!!  ",26-Feb-20

Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,I'm not really a big fan of Japanese food and coming from Sweden we have enough fish dishes without the need to eat more fish. This however is an excellent Sushi bar and all the food is presented in such a way that its hard not to be tempted.,12-Oct-19
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,It was a fantastic experience!! Very small place nicely decorated. Service was perfect and the food amazing.

Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,2,Negative,The place is just the outdoor seating area at the Mercado de Barcelo. Forus is just a small liquor stand between a couple of Peruvian food stands with a poor selection of ceviche. Service is poor and slow. Other food stands in the mercado had better food and service.,22-Feb-20
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"A truly spectacular meal at an unpretentious vegetarian/vegan restaurant close to the centre of Madrid. The waiters/waitresses were so attentive in a very friendly way. The food looked, smelt and tasted like no other vegetarian dishes I have ever been served before. Michelin - get your head in gear and start taking vegetarian food seriously and go and check this place out.",8-Dec-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,I'm not vegan bit I still loved it. Everybody is kind and the food is delicious. Just right next to Retiro.

Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,"We took fixed menu for a couple.Everything was amazing!The service was good, and the atmosphere as well.",12-Jul-19
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,"Very small place, 9 to 10 small tables, on a side street in Chueca (where everything is a walkable few small blocks away). No English menu but waiter very helpful. Food beautifully prepared with some unusual dishes, like the duck potstickers I sampled, and as tasty as any Japanese Restaurant I have eaten in on the US west coast and Hawaii. Reasonable prices for the food quality. Would return in a heartbeat if I had the time.",10-Jun-19

Restaurante_Morgana,4,Positive,"Reservation is a must! XD  We reserved the place 2 days ago. Can you imagine that, travelers? :)) we got the place at 10pm. The place isn't big but cozy. I love to eat where i can nicely sit not in the middle of many people who can staring at you whole the time. We served good here because the waiter took care & paid attention of every customer's needs very good. He also explained about all the foods we ordered and had. We ordered a portion of balls of croquettes as a starter. I had a portion of grilled octopus & my hubby had a portion of grilled meat as our main menu.  The taste of the croquettes were very nice. They were so crunchy outside and tender inside. It was great cooked. The octopus was amazingly delicious and tender. The meat was perfectly cook, tender and tasted great. ""They know what they do"", i can tell. We couldn't have the dessert :((. It was too pity! We were too full because whole day we had culinary XD. Don't miss it, travelers‚ù£",13-Apr-20
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"My favourite restaurant in Madrid. Friendly, fresh, wonderful interpretations of Galician food. My choices: The tomato! The Merluza. The BEST cheesecake ever.",7-Mar-20
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Found Morgana while researching Madrid restaurants and was not disappointed. There are only 12 small tables but in this business size doesn‚Äôt matter. We ordered; Marinated Tomatoes with guacamole, mango and fried basil. Grilled octopus with mashed potatoes and cheese sauce, Croca Roxa D‚ÄôOuro. And finished with Le Tarta De Queso De Morgana. Everything was amazing, especially the warm atmosphere and attentive staff. We are going back Friday for lunch!",26-Feb-20
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"A short menu of high quality Galician produce with a very creative asian and latin touch. The service is superb as is the wine (again short but well curated) list. A very good economic option for fine dining in Madrid. Don‚Äôt miss the tortilla not the cheesecake.  The place is tiny, so it can be a bit noisy and crowded. Make sure you book well in advance.

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,We were able to taste the best tapas we had ever tasted before. They have a lot of choices and their products are fresh.,25-Feb-20

Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,3,Negative,They can be affordable for many people  I visited the locations and very nice look  The names in every empanada  But with the wide food offer of Madrid this cannot be the top 5 sorry They thing is that most expensive restaurants are not affordable to all the people  So cannot be voted  It is okey like a kind of tapa  The locals are clean  After 152 countries moving around and being Spain citizen . We have more options for sure that resemble Spain food ,27-Jun-20
Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,5,Positive,A friend told us to stop by and taste their delicious pastries. We'll be back soon to try the empanadas again !,25-Feb-20
Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,5,Positive,"I went there because the place had a great review on TripAdvisor and it was a good choice. I took the bus from Prado Museum. The empanedas where delicious, the guy that was there was friendly and very polite. I would go again.",30-Dec-19
Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,5,Positive,"Great little place, best street food in Madrid. Can¬¥t do no wrong stopping by this place. Only problem is it¬¥s really small (just 4 bar stools inside) and doesn¬¥t have bathroom so it¬¥s really just for stop and go. But we still had our lunch here and were satisfied. Highly recommend.",18-Dec-19
Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,5,Positive,Grabbed a couple of empanadas for lunch (beef rib and fish) and were extremely tasty however you need a few as they are quite small (or my gut is too big) ü§î,2-Nov-19
Empanadas_Malvon_Bernabeu,5,Positive,Stopped in to grab something quick for lunch while we were on the go.  The Empanadas were fantastic and the price was very reasonable.  The spinach and ricotta empanada was outstanding.  Next time I'll get two of them.,11-Sep-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The Vinoteca Moratin was the best restaurant we ate at over a 6 day period in Madrid. It was quite close to the Prado Recommended by our 5 star hote l(Gran Hotel Ingles) which was not far away. Small seating area so you would definitely need a reservation in advance, as we saw many people turned away while we were eating.  My husband and I had a tomato soup appetizer, then I had cannelloni and my husband had a chicken dish. We split cheese cake for dessert and the wine by the glass was terrific and reasonable. A very long wine list with most wines available by the glass. Excellent staff and owner managed to talk to everyone, and was very welcoming. Love Madrid and found many very good restaurants on our 3rd trip there, but this was definitely the most memorable. A real find.",13-Apr-20
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,3,Negative,"Perhaps because it was sold to us like ""the place"" the expectations were high.  A nice place but nothing that could not have been eaten in other places in Madrid.",6-Jan-20
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Excellent atmosphere! Excellent food! Isabel and Pilar are two lovely sisters that pour their hearts out for their guests.

The violet ice cream is the best I have tasted.A real pleasure !!! Thank you. ,2-Mar-20
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Vinoteca Moratin provided all the components for an excellent evening - delicious food, interesting wines with a great selection by the glass, very pleasant surroundings and warm and attentive service by the owner and his staff. ( A special shout-out to Simon from our home town with whom we had a useful discussion about eating and drinking in Spain!). And the final bill was surprisingly modest too. There appeared to be many regulars there too, which we liked. Many people were turned away during the evening, so you need to book well ahead of time. But it‚Äôs definitely worth it - the whole experience was fabulous.",20-Feb-20
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"My wife, son and I just finished eating dinner at Moratin Restaurante. It was a great experience. We received personal attention from the time we came in to the time of our departure. The food was exceptional, prepared with fresh local ingredients. The service was impecable.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I had been planning to come here for a while, and luckily it didn't disappoint. It's a cosy, stylish space - relaxed but attractive and with a lovely buzzy but calm atmosphere. Service was attentive, friendly and engaged, by the owners. Food fresh and seasonal - we had a variety of fish, very fresh and interestingly cooked, plus some seasonal tomatoes which were full of flavour. As you would expect, wine is interesting and varied, and excellent value. I haven't seen many - if any- places like this in Madrid. Modern but not a poor imitation of trends; a menu that lets the ingredients shine; and a friendly and genuine environment",24-Dec-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Dining here solo was a very pleasant experience. The staff gave excellent service and food suggestions. The place is charming, cozy and well decorated. This restaurant is a little gem... I wasn‚Äôt sure I should be reviewing it at all as this review would mean the restaurant might be busier whenever I drop by to dine. They deserve a positive review though, kudos to Chema!",11-Dec-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,2,Negative,"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel, 5 minutes away. We booked and The Fork popped up, with a 30% discount on a booking for our date so we booked through this facility. When our bill arrived, the discount had not been made, so I pointed this out to a member of staff. This person made a fuss and when I told him that he was not being courteous, he shouted at me. The food is good, the staff are courteous overall, but the end of our evening was very upsetting. This member of staff speaks French, as do I, and that conversation revealed an appalling lack of basic respect in any situation, let alone for a paying customer. Still in a state of disbelief that a restaurant experience could be this.",26-Aug-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"This restaurant offers you the alternative to expensive restaurants around, still providing good service and high quality food. Tuna tataki was very good, as well as rolls.",15-Jul-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,1,Negative,"Went there with my kids at 7.30. Chose this place because on the website it stated it would be open from noon to midnight. A rude waiter ""greeted"" us an said the kitchen was closed. I asked if we could have a drink until the kitchen opens at 8 p.m. They were very busy he said but checked reservations. He ""allowed"" us to have a seat at one of the tables without ""reserved"" sign then he disappeared behind the bar desk. A very kind young waiter came to ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered and I asked if for the meantime they would have some olives (which in any restaurant in Spain you can order anytime of the day). The kind waiter, and sorry to point it out, but probably a Centralamerican, a Latino guy, said there were no Olives but Spanish Tortilla.... then the rude waier behind the desk lost it completely. He got angry and said he already mentinoned the kitchen was closed. I apologized and said I was just asking for Olives. He completely lost it, got loud, said again very angry the kitchen was closed and we have to wait until 8 p.m. I said, well sorry, we leave if it is too complicated to ask a simple question. And he pretty much through us out of the restaurant. The kind ""Latino"" (I should have asked for his name) apologized again and again, the rude guy threw us out with bad comments and the only 1 guest they had was looking shocked at the scene. Maybe food is good, the place looked nice, and one waiter would get highest core. The rude dude would not work in my establishment a single day. I may go back to give it another chance and hope the kind Latino is there. If seeing the rude guy I will leave instantly. Also on another note, maybe they do not like children. Fair enough. But considering we (me and kids of 8 and 6 yrs) went there at 7.30 which for Spain is very early and the place was empty (apart of 1 guest) I feel this guy is just doing the wrong job. Also, if it was about the kids just state kids are not welcome. Season just started and there was no reason to treat us that way. Bad experience! Disappointing experience!",17-May-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"You may expect fusion cuisine, but you have the right combination of traditional cuisine and new experiences. Mid / high price, but worth it, with a quite diverse menu, good wines and correct service. Well located, with a terrace for sunny days. Lot of dishes that are simply a must",30-Nov-18
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"Good food, especially the tempura shrimps. Reasonable prices and good staff with okay service. Went there 2 Times. The first time we were amazed about everything, second time not as amazed. Over all the best restaurant we visited during our stay.",12-Aug-18

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Amazing food.  It‚Äôs hard to find something more authentic and lovingly prepared in right in the heart of Madrid‚Äôs historic center.,2-Feb-20
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Run by two wonderful sisters and celebrating its 24tg year if you eat nowhere else in Madrid this place is the one to be. The tiny restaurant has so much warmth and ambience. Our host(ess) is warm, funny, a bit theatrical. Her sister, the chef, turns out exquisite locally sourced dished. They even have their own (delicious) wine. It was my second time, the first with a good friend, the second with my husband who was equally charmed Amazing wonderful. Go",18-Jan-20
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Run by two entertaining sisters, this is well worth a visit. You must make a reservation beforehand as it has no more than six tables and just one seating a night. Ask for suggestions. The menu consists of lots of interesting and unknown (at least to us) surprises for the La Rioja region.",29-Dec-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We were in Madrid for a couple of evenings between flights and after a day of battling the throngs clogging the city's Centro we decided an evening at Algarabia would be the proper therapy to soothe our nerves and palate! Isabel welcomed us like long lost friends at the door and escorted us to a quiet little table in the corner. Seems as if everyone else that evening was from Italy and having a grand time enjoying their meals and with lots wine flowing! We enjoyed our customery Marianito aperitif while we relaxed and viewed the Menu. To begin our therapy we chose the Leek and Duck Confit Salad and the Baby Artichokes Stuffed with Foie paired with a very cold and dry Cava, both seasonal specials and stunningly delicious. Our main courses were the Slow Cooked Lamb with Mint Chimichurri and the Pork Chumarro with Confit Onions. Both meltingly tender, cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Seems we were well on our way to a full recovery.. specially thanks to the excellent David Moreno Crianza house Rioja! Pilar's excellent 'Cold Cream' with Caramel and Pears in Red Wine completed our 'treatment' along with a surprising Dessert Cava and expressos for good behavior. Just made it to the Metro for the last train to Barajas that evening. Cheers!",16-Dec-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"While the swallows may return to Capistrano every March, we in turn choose to return to Algarabia every November to escape from the madness of Thanksgiving and Black Friday back home. After all of our travels and dining adventures Isabel, Pilar and Algarabia remain the closest to our hearts. Like the beloved Julia Child, Pilar exemplifies the 'Joy of Cooking' in every dish at Algarabia, served joyfully and with amazing grace by the inimitable Isabel. You will truly enjoy the Cuisine of Rioja at Algarab√≠a, but you will also be seduced by the warm hospitality and intimate atmosphere that this restaurant provides its guests. Over the years we have sampled many of Pilar signature dishes, yet each time we return we are thrilled by her new creations and off the menu seasonal specialties that Pilar and Isabel offer, often based on seasonal Rioja products, present their guests! One such surprise this year was a saute of Thistle, Boletus and Crispy Serrano Ham..WOW! who would have thought Thistle, of all things, could taste so good! Pilar also presented us with Crunchy Cones Filled with a Beef Tongue Salad.. an often maligned cut of beef elevated to high Riojan Cuisine. Old favorites we also enjoyed were Pilar's signature Rabo de Toro and Trigueros Crujiente, as well as the Bacalao a la Rioja. All this Joy was not experienced in one meal, we ate at Algarabia three times during our stay Madrid so that we had plenty of time to recover between Algarabia's feasts of the senses. Algarab√≠a is a celebration of Rioja, locally sourced products and warm attentive service.. we can hardly wait until next year's 'Black Friday' Chicas!!!",11-Dec-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We visited for Sunday lunch and looked at both the Menu del Dia and A la Carte choices. The Menu at 21.50 Euros provided 4 excellent starters shared by the table, a choice of 5 mains and dessert was a plate of at least 8 different puddings shared by the table. All the dishes were very well prepared and presented, a high standard of cooking. There was a comprehensive well priced wine list. Service was excellent too, very nice helpful staff and the owner also took time to talk to us. We were also offered a complimentary chupito after the meal, a nice touch which we appreciated. Very impressed with the whole experience and could not fault the food, service or atmosphere. Hope to be able to eat here again when visiting Madrid.",12-Jan-20

Eiffel,5,Positive,"My experience at this inconspicuous family owned and run restaurant was amazing. Each dish on the tasting menu was visually beautiful and the flavors were as pleasing to the taste and smells for each of the 3 starters, and each of the main dishes, followed by a spectacular dish of desserts of pastry, flan, violet ice cream, and more. The wine selection was outstanding, and I enjoyed their house Crianza, a tempranillo that was perfect as much as I enjoyed the Verdejo. Miguel made us feel that we were his guests and not customers.",11-Jun-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We visited the restaurant last time in March 2016 an we were so impressed about the excellent food and hospitality. So we needed to come back. So we made an reservation and surprisingly, Miguel, the owner and Chef immediately remembered us. At our arrival we were treated as friends. Miguel prepared an outstanding tasting menue for us. A 9 dishes menue, one dish more delicious than the next. His own wine recommendation fitted perfectly. Even if the restaurant is a little bit outside, it¬¥s an absolute must during a stay in Madrid. During our five days in Madrid we went two times to this marvellous restaurant. At our second visit, I requested a small change from the recommended menue and I ordered tatar. Miguel prepared in front of my table the most delicious one for a long time. We hope that we have the chance to travel again to Madrid. This restaurant allone is worth the visit.",4-Nov-18

An easy walk from our hotel, the Intercontinental Madrid, we were welcomed by our friendly host, Jose (Jota) who made the evening superb! A glass of Spanish wine, roasted peppers as an appetizer followed by Paella for two and cheesecake to top it off! Jose was an AMAZING host who took very good care of these two Americans! This was the best evening of the week thanks to Jose!",24-Feb-20

We are foodies and know our Italian food. This was simply sublime. Everything was sublime. And the atmosphere was friendly, trendy and homely at the same time.

Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Great dinner, just the place to go when you want real food and had enough with the Tapas sorts. Greek food is always a winner. It's fresh, healthy, filling and makes you feel good. Go there, it's wonderful. Service was great, prices were fine.",16-Oct-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"My wife and I came across this place while wandering back from a gig and wanted something a bit different. We‚Äôre a bit tapased out.  Really friendly staff, quick service and a gorgeous mixed grill for 2 followed by karidopita.  Loved it and well worth a visit.",4-Oct-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"Had the menu of the day here and was very pleasantly surprised at its taste and variety. The service was good and the main waiter efficient. However, went back the next day and it was not as good. The service was a shambles and when the bill came we had been under charged with items missed and prices haphazard. We considered this fare payback and left. Will not return.",4-Oct-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"My family like greek food from the time when we live in Athena for two years. Now we live in Madrid .We decide to try it .Service was normal , all salads tsatsiki , eggplant , cheese salad was frozen one not made it at the moment . Sausages was low quality but very low if we compare with greek one . We eat it some beef minced meat inside with cheese but we can eat it all because they bring it over over cooked . If you expect real good greek food unfortunately it s not here .",8-Sep-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Came to this restaurant on a very hot day and had some lentil soup, even though it was hot it tasted so good.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I have just arrived in Madrid where I am speaking at a conference. I left the hotel and looked at 6 restaurants before choosing Moratin. What a great choice. A great atmosphere, a chef who explains the preparation of the menu and superb simple food. To quote Royce ‚Äúsomething done well, however simple, is noble‚Äù. This is simple food at another level of texture and flavour. By now, you have guessed I liked it. ",19-Nov-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,This was a quiet good food place to meet. Not a lot of table space but when you finish eating you will be satisfied. Seafood is wonderful here. Very family oriented. Nice atmosphere.,16-Nov-19

El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,3,Negative,The food was good but the service was not. There was such a long wait between the first and second course that I had to get up and see what was happening. Shame really...it was a birthday lunch and we felt let down.,17-Jun-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The hostess, who is the sister of the cook, was so nice and really made us feel at home. Explained the menu well because my Spanish is really bad. I had the sweetbreads with beans and it was fantastic if you like that sort of thing. Then pork medallions and desert. It's really intimate and the food is very good so give it a try you will not regret.",10-Dec-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This is a family run restaurant with riojan specialities. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening here, not only the spectacular food but also the atmosphere. It is very cosy with personalized service. My husband ordered the sweetbreads and claimed they were some of the best he's ever had..and he has had a lot! It was certainly one of the best meals we had during our stay in Madrid and we will seek it out again on our next visit. The food is prepared lovingly and the service is excellent. It makes you wish more restaurants are still run this way. A real five star experience.",24-Nov-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We visited this restaurant on our first night in Madrid and it was the best night and meal of our holiday. Totally unassuming from outside, but when you get inside it‚Äôs like eating in someone‚Äôs dining room. The Rioja and the food was delicious, and Isabel and Pilar were warm and friendly. This is a very unique restaurant! Reservations are a must. Don‚Äôt miss out! ",10-Nov-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,Such outstanding food. Delicious with a beautiful presentation.  Service was second to none.  This is a small neighborhood type family owned restaurant.  Reservations suggested.,4-Jun-18
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We made a reservation for 6 on our first night in Madrid as we had read great reviews. It took us 20 minutes by cab to get there from our hotel. It turned out to be like a party for us. When we arrived, we were greeted with a handmade place card welcoming us by name. Delicious smoked hummus with plantain chips was served. We ordered homemade tapas appetizers: a thinly sliced procuittolike beef with extra virgin olive oil; potatoes croques that were moist and creamy;& empanadas filled with beef. Our main coarse was entrecote (4) & bacala(2). The presentation & service was perfect. The steak was cooked to each persons choice & the fish was steamy & moist. Some flavors were new to us & tasty. The owner/ server had been to 5 years of chef preparatory school. He was extremely attentive and charming. He speaks English. We recommend creme catalan for dessert with Spanish flag on top!",9-Feb-18
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Eiffel is one of those restaurants you don't find in Madrid where you call to book and even the way they pick up the phone is friendly. The effort and attention of the owners was exceptional.  The place looks a bit suspicious from the outside (old Spanish bar where you'd only find a Russian salad and bad wine). But as soon as you walk in, this changes. So don't be afraid. It's worth it. There's free parking around the area so that's a +10 points.  The food was beautiful: spinach pie, cecina, the ferrero was wow! and so were the prawns and salad. We all looved it. The dessert was ok and the wine was fine for the price we paid! The owners did so many things to make us feel comfortable and happy I can't start to describe. All I can say is... what are you waiting for? Try Eiffel! Amigos de Sudafrica will visit you again soon!!",18-Dec-17
Eiffel,5,Positive,we arrived in Madrid after a long journey and Eiffel kindly held our table until we arrived at 11:30pm. The team made us feel super comfortable and helped us relax very quickly. The air-con was very welcome too.  The menu is varied and each of the dishes we tried was nicely prepared and well presented. The wine list is extensive and the kids had a really nice selection of things to eat including a great ice cream. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Madrid. The Tuna Burger is particularly lovely.,21-Jun-17
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,It‚Äôs a great restaurant. The service it‚Äôs amazing. And the owner makes you feel an a great experience. Recommend for everyone who stayed near the place. And it‚Äôs close to the stadium Santiago Bernab√©u.,7-Feb-20

Gustazio_Gastrobar,5,Positive,"I just been with my friend here and we both absolutely loved this place! From the moment you step in you can feel the Italian spirit... this guys know exactly what they are doing, everything was great from the starter (parmigiana and the selection of meat and Cheese) to the mains, my pasta was exceptional and the Pinsa was amazing too.  Very good menu, fresh and high standard products. We had a very enjoyable night and we will definitely come back soon... maybe tomorrow for the Italian aperitivo!  Grazie mille e buona fortuna... vi auguro il successo che assolutamente meritate! ",2-Apr-19

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"My husband and I stopped at Level for lunch as we were exploring Madrid. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the manager, who was very hospitable and made us feel right at home. Since it is a tapas-style, vegan restaurant, we asked many questions (how many to order, what all of the ingredients were, etc), and he and our server were so accommodating and helpful with their guidance. We ended up ordering four dishes to split and all four were absolutely delicious. All of the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù on the dishes is made from nuts, and my husband could not believe it because it was so tasty. My favorite dish was the veggie lasagna, which had an amazing red sauce and was topped with ‚Äúparmesan‚Äú made out of Brazil nuts.  Neither my husband nor I are vegan or vegetarian ‚Äî we both eat meat, poultry and fish ‚Äî and we would recommend Level Veggie Bistro to anyone! Definitely one of the best meals we had in Madrid.",5-Jul-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Delicious and great customer service! Recommended to everyone, vegan and non. The zucchini lasagna was awesome!!",27-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"What a fantastic bistro. Absolutely couldn‚Äôt fault anything. We hadn‚Äôt booked but they still found a way to accommodate me and my friends and make us feel welcome.  The service was friendly yet professional. My Spanish is embarrassingly poor, but the waiters and waitresses explained everything in very good English. Even my friends who firmly believe that every meal should contain meat were very satisfied with our food. They had no idea that vegetables could be so delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the way we shared all starters and main courses, and so got to taste everything. And it was definitely worth it. The food was amazing - creative and full of flavour.  I would absolutely recommend this bistro to everyone.",20-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"This is probably one of the best vegan/vegetarian restaurants we have been to. Food was exceptional. Offered English language menu option and staff explained every dish that we ordered. Everything was fresh and made to order. Would highly recommend the lasagna it was one of the best I ever had, with thin slices of zucchini used as noodles. Buddha bowl was excellent and the veggie pate was great. I would definitely recommend making a reservation unless you arrive right when they open for dinner at 8:00 pm.",14-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We arrived in Madrid by train this morning and checked into our hotel just to the east of the Retiro park. An easy 20 minute stroll to Level Veggie Bistro. Bright, contemporary decor, well spaced tables and good lighting. Excellent, friendly and efficient service. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty. Even though the restaurant was full, service was reasonably quick, with no pressure to vacate the table. Important to book as the restaurant can be very busy. Not cheap but good value considering the quality and quantity of the food and the elegant surroundings.",7-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Only one of our party is a vegan but we all had different starters and mains and had an incredible meal! Staff were superb: knowledgeable about the food and really friendly with great recommendations, all while dealing with us classic brits who had made no effort to learn Spanish! Can‚Äôt fault the evening we had!",1-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,4 of us went - I am vegan but 3 friends are not.  We told the waiter to give us what he recommended and ended up with a kind of degustation - was fabulous!  Everyone loved it and raves about the food.,26-May-19
Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,3,Negative,"The terrace was great, great views but the food really disappointing Tartar de solomillo was good, but everything else, not for me",21-Sep-16
Level_Veggie_Bistro,4,Positive,"We really don't want to give negative reviews to a place which is obviously trying hard to do good things, but we found it was overated and overpriced. Too much emphasis on presentation - both of the food and by the waiting staff - and it didn't live up to expectations. Like an earlier reviewer, we left feeling hungry. Why not offer an honest to goodness veggie/vegan salad with an exciting dressing, a homemade bean burger with fried onions, a well spiced hummos dish, a delightfully fresh Gazpacho?? We love the concept of a vegan restaurant in the heart of Spain. A number of them seem to be thriving. If you're doing well, ignore our thoughts. If you're not, perhaps take heed.",28-Jul-17
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We visited Level Veggie Bistro for lunch in Madrid. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation, but the staff accommodated us even though all the tables were booked.

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We really enjoyed our food at Level. The asparagus bistro was great. The vegan lasagne was really good as well. With raw food, the ingredients need to be fresh and tasty - and they got it spot on for this dish. The mushroom papillot was yummy. Hopefully we get a chance to come again before we leave Madrid. Great service and location.",10-Apr-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Walked in without a booking for dinner & staff made the effort to accommodate us. We went for the taster menu - 6 courses of vegan/ raw vegan taste bud sensations. Food tasted amazing, was presented like art pieces & each course was varied in taste & texture. If I had to criticise anything it was the lack of delay between courses - possibly too quick. Staff were friendly & knowledgable about each course. My husband (who is an unapologetic carnivore) admitted he enjoyed every mouthful but decided when he got the bill he couldn‚Äôt afford to be a full time veggie!! I thought it was worth every cent! If you want to try a vegan restaurant that shows off the potential of vegetables, nuts & fruit this is a must place to dine in - super!! ",24-May-19
Sto_Globo_Sushi_Room,5,Positive,"Came from The United States w my girlfriend and we both loved this place. It is a very nice and quiet place, perfect located in Madrid‚Äôs downtown. The quality of the products are quite good and the price is more than reasonable. I‚Äôm looking forward to come back.",2-Jun-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,4,Positive,"Cozy atmosphere with a kind and accurate service. The menu is interesting and dishes are good, even though the size of the portions is not that big. Mushrooms were well combined and delicate and desserts very tasty and a pleasure for the eyes; some others plates, instead, seemed to be a bit too abundant in salt and missing some character. We paid over 80‚Ç¨ for 2 starters, 2 main dishes, 2 desserts and 2 juices - the missing star is for the price-per-value rate: probably 10/15% lower prices and the whole combination would be perfect. All considered, a positive experience. Advised!",30-Nov-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,2,Negative,My husband (a vegetarian with decidedly vegan preferences) and I went here on a recent holiday and were stunned by the difference between our experience and other TA reviews. The first starter was OK. The second - white asparagus - was so bad we couldn't finish it... With a nutty puree that didn't match and an undertone that tasted almost canned. The next main was decidedly unremarkable. The raw lasagne was the highlight of the meal (and the only dish we would eat again). The atmosphere was good and the server attentive.. But in the end our three other vegetarian meals in Madrid were better. We will not return and do not recommend ,26-May-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Having read rave reviews abou the restaurant, we decided to give it a try. We were more than impressed.

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,My family and I think this restaurant serves some of the best vegan food in Spain. We brought a fourteen year old and two omnivore 11 year old boys and they all ate everything and really enjoyed it. One of them even had a green juice type drink and loved it! The lasagna was delicious. The hamburger was the best vegan hamburger I've ever had and the desserts were great. We highly recommend it. Also it is right across the street from the Retiro so your kids can play or you can take a long walk before or after eating. The only thing to know is to call ahead or make a reservation online as it was full on a sunny Saturday in February.,3-Mar-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"This was by far the best vegan restaurant we tried during our stay in Madrid! Menu is almost half raw dishes and is very diverse and imaginative. We had 2 starters, 2 main dishes, and 2 desserts, and all were amazing. My favorite was the asparagus with pumpkin and hazelnut - a perfect balance of flavors! Atmosphere is relaxed, it‚Äôs properly staffed and you never need to wait on anything, the team was very personable. Overall a great foodie experience.",1-Mar-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"A little late this review on TA, but I noted that Facebook has deleted it and I don't want my experience to go unnoted. This is by far the best vegan restaurant we've been to and for me it was a repeat experience. The first visits in 2017, three nights in a row and in October 2018 four days in a row - three dinners one lunch. Right from the first impression (there‚Äôs never a second chance!) to the very end everything was simply perfect. A beautifully designed restaurant with many fine details, hospitality at its best with fantastic, attentive and swift service. Professionals at work! We've eaten everything(!) on the menue, some multiple times. Starters are amazing: The 24 hour Falafel, Veggie Rolls and Mushroom Brochettes. All three intense flavours due to the dehydration (Falafel and Veggie Roll) and the creamy pesto Genovese in the Mushroom Brochettes... Bellissimo! Pesto with pistachios, what an ingenious combination! Mushroom Papillote, what a taste explosion ‚Äì not just mushrooms but ‚Äûfancy‚Äú varieties and the sauce with Tarragon and a hint of Pernod ‚Äì wow! The other evening I had the crepe which was delicious and a host of herbs and tastes... For lunch the following day I went for the burger ‚Äì the best ever! The bun toasted in a way I‚Äôve never experienced before and it was actually possible to eat it with your hands and in such a way they stayed clean. Wedges well spiced and ‚Äûketchup‚Äú and ‚Äûmayonnaise‚Äú outstanding.  The desserts, WOW!  Cheese Cake, Frozen Petals, Double Chocolate Cake and Strawberry Kisses.  All desserts are out of this world. The texture and taste of the Cheese Cake amazing, the same with the Double Choc ‚Äì best ever and very fine! Frozen Petals ‚Äì just go for it, an experience in itself and not to be mistaken for ice cream. Strawberry Kisses... dehydrated layers of strawberry filled with Vanilla Cream ‚Äì OMG. Another dessert out of Heaven.  Considering all desserts are made with raw natural sweeteners and NO sugar and me being a Sweet Tooth & Chocoholic, I bow before you, oh great Goddess in the kitchen - her name is actually Julie - The Quality Queen behind all these delicious dishes!  We will be back this year because in Germany we can't find this kind of Fine Dining where every box can be ticked and best marks/rates cannot be enough. Looking forward to our next visits!",6-Apr-19

Level_Veggie_Bistro,2,Negative,"Chose this restaurant based on the reviews and being vegetarian. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. However, the staff quite rude and unaccommadating. We arrived at 2pm the restaurant was empty. Maybe 3 tables with diners. We were told the restaurant is fully booked and no tables available. So we decided to order takeaway and eat in the beautiful park across the road and if any customers don't turn up if we could be seated. 30 mins later still empty tables. The food arrived but still were refused seating even though there were lots of empty tables. Sad to leave a bad review on the service and weren't able to enjoy the restaurant.",6-Apr-19

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,We had lunch here on our last day in Madrid. Perfectly located across the road from the Buen Retiro park and with good transport links nearby. A very friendly welcome and the team speak good English so there was no need to attempt our poor Spanish! We ordered the pate and crackers and mushroom brochettes to start with. Then for our mains we had the raw lasagne and the mushroom papillot. All of the food here was incredible but in particular the mushroom dishes were AMAZING. The mushrooms in the starter dish were filled with a pesto sauce and the papillot tasted of tarragon and pernod and were served with the softest rice. We would definitely return here.

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"I have been dabbling with a plant based diet for several months and struggle to find tasty healthy options when out of my home environment. While in Madrid we tried several vegetarian restaurants with disappointing results - they all seemed to forget that the whole object is to eat healthy. Then we found Level and that all changed. My recommendation is more in the form of an imperative - go there!!!  The food was exceptional, the service more than exceptional. We left satisfied in every way. This is the best food we had in Madrid. ",5-May-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Very comfortable and stylish. The service is very good indeed, friendly, warm and professional.

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We had a great experience in the restaurant. All the staff speaks english very good, we got recommendations for the meals. Tried pumpkin soup, refreshing salad, lasagnas and hamburgers. Everything was amazing and a harmony of tastes. We even ordered desert to try the raw cakes they offer. Maybe it is a little pricey but it is worth the money.",21-Apr-19

Level_Veggie_Bistro,4,Positive,"Actually this vegan restaurant deserves a five star because it delivered my expectations on food quality, freshness, taste and the ambience. However one factor stopped me. When the waiter came, we had already made our choice, which was one Mezze starter plate and one main dish for each one of us. However, he insisted that we should get another starter which we followed and at the end ended very full and heavy (in order not to waste food). The philosophy behind vegan food is that it is basic, simple with preferably zero waste and this behavior contradicts with that. I understand the motivation to increase the check/table but this shouldn‚Äôt be the case here. ",25-Nov-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,One of the best vegan restaurant I have been. We took the ‚Äúmenu de degustaci√≥n‚Äù for 2 persons and it was delicious.

I can‚Äôt wait to work my way through the menu and will definitely be back this trip and next. Two big thumbs up, plus the service was impeccable. ",27-Feb-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,My partner had suggested to come here and I had reservations due to not being keen on raw food. Well! They proved me wrong! The raw lasagne was amazing. So many amazing flavours. This restaurant has changed my opinion on raw food.,26-Feb-19
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We found this restaurant using the HappyCow app as it was the nearest vegan restaurant when we finally had some time for a late lunch. It's in a great location next to the Retiro park and we luckily got a table near the entrance with a lovely view of the park. As we decided to order three different starters and mains and share them among the three of us, they brought us each dish separately so we could savour and enjoy. Every time they served us a dish, the waiting staff explained what it was made of. The starters were tasty but on the small side. The mains, however, were amazing (although we shouldn't have ordered the burger in hindsight as it was difficult to divide into three and not as special as the other dishes). Especially good was the house specialty, the raw lasagna. We're not big fans of raw food and only ordered it on the waiter's recommendation but we're so glad we did as it was fantastic. For dessert, we had double chocolate cake and two chocolate mousses, which were both scrummy. Although our meal cost around twice as much as in other vegan restaurants we tried while in Madrid, it was definitely worth it. And the service was friendly and excellent.",25-Feb-19

Everything was simply great, beyond expectations: local and decoration simple and natural, no need to complicate things..! The service was superattentive, and offered us full advice when going through the menu... so difficult to choose, so many interesting things to taste!! All was really good, but green lasagna was superb! We ended having 2 desserts, both outstanding and nicely presented in plates! Good range of natural beers, the best one was from carabanchel! And all that luxury at a moderate price!! Only ""but""we can say is that beers should be served chilly (please...)!! In 2 words: a temple for veggies... and for everyone!!",19-Mar-19

Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,1,Negative,"This morning my brother and I arrived at the Azotea Forum. We ordered 2 eggs benedictine that also comes with fruit, yogurt, bread, fresh orange and coffee.  We ordered promptly and were left waiting for 40 minutes for the breakfast to arrive... within this time their was no apology and the no sign of our drinks. For the record we were the only people in the restaurant!  The food arrived and to our horror the eggs resembled water and they were cold. I spoke to the waiter and he said that they should be semi-cooked. I have eaten eggs benedictine all around the world but nothing like this.. what irritated me more than anything was the bad attitude of the waiter. I spoke politely considering the experience we had.. no apology so we stood up and left.. I seldom write reviews on here but I do enjoy eating out and will always give credit where it is due. I really hope you don't visit this place as they do not deserve to be in business. I don't believe this place will be open if it were not for the terrace. By the way the views aren't impressive..",29-Mar-18

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"I came here with my wife and two teenage daughters and we all loved the food. The Mezze Platter and Timbal de Quinoa to start with - good sized portions, excellent quality and seem to have been prepared with a lot of attention to detail and affection.  Then two of us had the lasa√±a - cold, which surprised us, but very tasty and light. The Burger and Burrito were more filling but also much appreciated. A plate of iced p√©talos to share for dessert and we left very contented, thinking about what we would order on our next visit (perhaps a starter each and then a dessert each - we'll see!). A small but varied selection of craft beers too - the B√°ias from el pa√≠s vasco was very good, though at 6%, stronger than expected - I mistook the price (4.1) for the alcohol content. Suggestion: put 4,10 with a euro sign on the men√∫. Anyway, highly recommended and a very pleasant eating experience as a family. It's not cheap, mind, but very good value for money.",8-Oct-17

La_Gaditana_Castellana,3,Negative,"We wanted to enjoy this restaurant like we did the others on our Spain vacation, but this one, to our surprise (considering other reviews) was just disappointing. The atmosphere is nice, but it ends there.  My husband and our two children were seated right by the door for some reason, despite us having a reservation and the place was completely empty. Trouble is, there was constantly a breeze from the door with waiters coming in and out. People started to pile in within 30 min, so that created more discomfort with the breeze. The food was bla. Sardines and salad with anchovies were the highlights. We also had the shrimp rice dish, it was a disappointment (and at first they got the order wrong). Our kids barely touched it. My husband ordered the salmon tartar with mango and avocado, it was flavorless. English is a challenge, almost nobody understood. The waiters tried, but it was just so average. Don‚Äôt recommend, better options elsewhere. ",22-Feb-19

I've always been a meat-eater, but when food can be this good without any meat, even I begin to wonder why anyone would ever eat meat at all. Everything we had was delicious, beautifully presented and in generous portions. I can thoroughly recommend the mushroom brochettes as a starter, and e.g. Fabrizio's veggie hamburger is a real treat. Best of all, knowing that after such a hearty lunch, everything you've eaten is healthy, natural, and free of sugar, fasts and additives. The best thing you can do is go and try it yourself.",17-Jan-19

How tasty it was! Three of us shared the pancakes and all felt the same: very delicious and wanted more!  We went on to the main dishes such us vegan burger, lasagne and a dish with mixed mushrooms, rice, creamy sauce and some hint of anise. Hmmm...all tasty and not just pleasing to tastebuds but eyes!

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"No, it's not Spanish food, but boy was it delicious! As vegetarians, it's hard to find food in Madrid that does not have ham or meat. Level was the answer to our prayers! Extremely friendly wait staff (Pablo and Marko were great!), an English menu, extremely clean premises and innovative vegan dishes that are sure to please the palate. It's not cheap so if you're on a budget, this restaurant is definitely for a special occasion (in our case, our daughter's birthday). We had no regrets spending a little more for a very memorable meal. We wanted to skip dessert as we were quite satiated, but Pablo convinced us to give one a try. The vegan cheesecake was smooth and creamy and delicious. Would go back just for another slice.  Buddha bowl was OK. Likely wouldn't order that item again though the addition of green apples gave the salad a tart crunch.",13-Jul-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Great vegan restaurant!  Not the usual vegan option, which is too informal and where food lacks taste. This place can make anyone go vegan! The service was amazing since the beginning, waiters were all really friendly and make you feel cozy since you come inside. We ordered a tasting menu that would have plates suggested by the maitre. We had six plates that were all full of taste and didn't disappoint. I'm not a fan of mushroom and in this place I enjoyed the best pesto mushroom of my life.  Please, try the raw lasagne! It was my favorite dish :) We will definitely come back when we visit Madrid again!",11-Jul-18

La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,This restaurant was right next to our hotel and very well rated. Indeed the food was excellent and the service good. You need to be careful how much you order as many tables ended up with way too much food. It is best to share dishes so you can taste various things and enjoy. The red tuna tartar was excellent and the fish selection excellent. Try the artichokes dish as well. ,28-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"All of the dishes were excellent. I would definitely recommend the fried truffled eggs with spicy tuna and the oxtail. The desserts (mostly different cakes) were not as good as the starters and main plates, but still enjoyable. Definitely try the tortillitas de camarones as well. The lighting in the restaurant is also great for fooling you into believing it‚Äôs not too late in the night.",27-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"It¬¥s a restaurant with the best services. We have known much better spain culture through then. We like very much how their live his gastronomic.

La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We were in family having dinner, my husband, my little girl and I. The atmosphere was great, the food we loved, we ate Jamon, seafood, and very tasty paella, and the desserts oh my god, delights!   The treatment was great and very friendly with my daughter.  When we return to Madrid we will visit the restaurant again, for sure.",26-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,Cozy place...and best service in Castellana's area... reasonable prices for the great spanish food taste in full expression..don't forget to get a glass of Rioja wine at the terrace! ,15-Jan-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Great place, great meal, great staff! We had outstanding personal attention by our waiter, Driss. It was our first visit to Madrid and his recommendations were perfect. The meal was one of the best I‚Äôve had in a long time and at a reasonable price. I can‚Äôt recommend enough!",15-Dec-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"After only two days in Madrid I was desperate for fresh vegetables. It turns out this is much more than that. Really delicious vegan (and some raw) dishes. The Buddha bowl was a beautiful salad, but better than that, with chick peas, mache, sweet potato and kale that had been crisped with a dusting of something delicious. The juices were better and more subtle than any I've had. (I loved Soul -- crisp, refreshing, like a hit of all the freshness and nutrients my body was craving. The desserts were so good we had more than we should have.  Service was excellent. When we're back in Madrid we plan to eat here at least once a day.",21-Oct-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We were greeted by a funny and friendly waiter, and were offered to change tables if we didn't like ours, which is great! The food was spectacular and perfect in all senses. Yeah, it's a bit pricey but this is after all a pretty ''fine dining'' experience - which when compared to regular restaurants of this sort isn't that expensive. The ambience was absolutely lovely. Will definitely come back.",21-Oct-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"My vegan daughter and I are on a mission to find the best vegan food in Madrid and I think we‚Äôve found it in this fabulous restaurant. We opted for the chef‚Äôs taster menu and had plate after plate of vegan deliciousness placed in front of us. Everything was so beautifully prepared and presented with such culinary artistry it would definitely be an Instagrammers dream! The staff were friendly and helpful, checking on any tastes or ingredients we didn‚Äôt like or were allergic too, and the chef came to our table at the end to see how we had enjoyed the meal (as if the totally empty plates going back hadn‚Äôt already told her how satisfied we were!). It wasn‚Äôt cheap but the price reflected the quality of the food and worth every penny. I will definitely be back, especially with my meat eating friends to prove to them that vegan food is not just hummus and avocado!",15-Oct-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,This was definitely one of the best vegan restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. They explain everything that‚Äôs in the food when they bring it over to you. It‚Äôs not somewhere you can just stop off at on your lunch as it‚Äôs expensive but definitely worth a try. ,3-Dec-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,4,Positive,"because 5 of us were traveling together for 2 weeks: 5 nights in Madrid and 7 nights in Seville. Daughter and S I L are vegan.....adult son, hubby and i eat anything. I really can't remember what we had........but everything was presented well, waitstaff was attentive and we DID have a bottle of wine w/dinner. When I got the bill i challenged the waiter because we were charged more for a few items......I was told that prices changed a month ago. WELL...........print up a new menu! Our bill was 168.2 euros not incl tip. i think if you are vegan LEVEL can excite you...",30-Nov-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"My husband and I and another couple are all vegan and have been on a two week trip between Lisbon, Barcelona and Madrid. Hands down, Level was the best food and for sure the best experience of all of the restaurants we‚Äôve gone to between the 3 cities. Myself and the other girl are pregnant, so Pablo customized a menu tasting for the 4 of us to share of cooked food that was amazing! We shared 3 appetizers and 3 entrees and then opted for sharing 4 of the desserts after. Everything was amazing, the service was polite and friendly and super accommodating. My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt find it sooner, and that I didn‚Äôt take any more pictures throughout the dinner to share online. ",30-Nov-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"We let the chef compose a mix of dishes to share for lunch and that was an excellent decision.

Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"After spending a long day at the Prado Museum, my friend and I were looking for a reasonably priced vegetarian meal on a rainy evening in Madrid. I read others favorable reviews of the Level Bistro which is a 10 minute walk from the museum through the Retiro Park. Although we didn‚Äôt have reservations, Andres greeted us warmly, and Pablo, our server, suggested we share the Buddha Bowl salad and Mushroom Papillote. Wonderful flavors in both and a perfect combo. Great farm to table restaurant.",3-Jun-18
Level_Veggie_Bistro,5,Positive,"Found this quite by chance near our apartment and what a gem it was! Everything sounded so good so we asked them to pick for us and we were not disappointed. The flavours in every dish were just amazing and there is nothing I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. A real treat for vegans/veggies and anyone who appreciates fresh, healthy food.",14-Apr-18
La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"We had just gotten in to Madrid and were starving so after consulting Trip Advisor we decided on this restaurant not too far from our hotel on the Gran Via.  We shared some jamon iberico to go with their delicious bread and also ordered some stuffed tomatoes that came three in the order and were delicious. We all ordered the solomillo and thoroughly enjoyed it, though one member of our party was disappointed because though he sent it back it still was too undercooked for him. Keep in mind that the Spanish don't normally eat well done or overcooked meats so if this is how you like it then make a point of telling your server.  We washed down our dishes with a wonderful Ribera del Duero red wine. For dessert I had an interesting rice cream concoction with a tiny scoop of ice cream. The others in our party had ice creams that came in small jars,the chocolate was very rich.  Service was excellent and friendly. Wasn‚Äôt inexpensive but worth it! ",22-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,Typical spanish cuisine with well-executed dishes. The service is efficient and the ambience is welcoming. The value-for-money is adequate.,15-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"Reasonable priced Spanish restaurant. Great food selection, good service - mostly. Good wine list. The meat dishes were a little fatty - in the traditional way. I suppose this is how they were meant to be. We didn‚Äôt need a reservation as we were early (before 8 pm). At the end we still paid just over ‚Ç¨100 for two people. Recommended.",14-Jun-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,"My first day in Madrid and to feel the hospitality of Madrid at Eiffel restaurant was a great experience. It was a little bit difficult to communicate, but the owner called her brother (co-owner) to speak to me through the phone. The food was great and we got to try a lot of different food as she would bring a dish for the 3 of us. I definitely recommend this restaurant!",20-Dec-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"This is beyond a five star restaurant in that the ambiance was amazing...the food was incredibly delicious..and the owners/staff were incredibly lovely. We had to meet the chef, who is the hierarchy of the family...Mom. It is obvious she had poured all her love in the incredibly delicious tapas.  It is a little out of our way..however well worth the trip!! FYI: I sent an email to the owner stating we would like a 7 pm reservation. I received a response that read: we open at 8 however if you arrive early we will serve you! Truly a magical family owned, five star restaurant!!",27-Jun-15

Eiffel,5,Positive,"Our dining in this restaurant was a top experience. The food was good and in combination with the desire of all staff to make your dining with them the best experience possible I can only provide the highest recommendation possible. they go out of their way to provide information about the food, help you choose and all that in a relaxed atmosphere. Paul and Rick Hoefnagels",7-Aug-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,Loved the food and service. Went here with the two little ones after spending the morning at the zoo. Our adult treat to have a nice lunch before long drive home. The service was great. Children treated very nicely. Our son had a special meal with his favorite things. We had a yummy salad and perfect steak. Cant fault the place. Worth a visit even if it is out of your way. The place does not look like much from the outside but you will be pleasantly surprised.,30-Jul-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Read the reviews for this restaurant and planned a visit when we decided to go to the zoo for the day, as it was in the vicinity. We walked around in the heat for quite a while before finding The Eiffel and arrived at 5.30pm! They had just closed serving food at 5pm and were re-opening at 8pm! I think, from the look on our faces, at Death's Door!, they especially served us food! :-) The staff were so welcoming and helpful. We were very grateful, after making the effort to try their restaurant, that they were so accommodating. The restaurant is basic but the food was great and the waiter explained the menu and made recommendations. We left with full, contented bellies :-)  I would recommend eating and having a few drinks at The Eiffel.",20-Jul-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"My wife and I ate here last night due to the reviews on trip advisor.  How happy we are that we did.  I reserved a table by email a week ago and had an instant response.  We wanted to book for Sunday night but was told by Miguel the owner that unfortunately they didn't open late in the evening on Sunday's.  So I then requested Saturday night which was fine.  I got to the airport yesterday morning and forgot the time I reserved so sent a mail requesting a reminder, when we got to Madrid there was a mail for me and he said that our table was booked come when you like. Fantastic.  Can I just say that from the start to the end of the evening everything from the food to the service was Superb.  The staff are very friendly and courteous, we were asked if we had a reservation and shown to our table outside, it had my name on it, then we had drinks and said we just wanted to wait to order for a bit.  While we sat Miguel came and introduced himself, we spoke in Spanish but he speaks broken English and his staff do.  When we were ready we asked for the menu, they do tapas and mains so my wife had tempura prawns and morcillo black sausage, delicious, and I had cured ham with olive oil and herbs and solomillo steak with fried potatos and peppers, again delicious.  When the bill came we couldn't believe how reasonable it was, 2 large beers, 3 glasses of wine and the food came to ‚Ç¨55.  At the end of the evening Miguel unlocked a gate and showed us a shortcut back to the metro.  You must visit this restaurant, we stayed in the Liabeny Hotel in the centre of Madrid and it was easy to get there. Directions Gran Via Metro buy a single ticket ‚Ç¨1.60 get to track 1 and go 1 stop to Tribunal, go to track 10 and get on train 5 stops to Casa de Campo, get off train and go out of the station go straight on ( stay on right side ) walk under the road over slip road to next junction, turn right, right again at the next junction and Eiffel is 150m on the right. Easy.  Muchas Gracias Miguel y Familia Fantastico. ",21-Jun-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,The service was lovely with the lady at the bar accomadating our bad Spanish. The owner who could speak great English talked us through the menu and even brought out copies of it in english. The food was beautiful and so was the atmosphere. Great value for money also. We stayed for over 2 hours sitting out in the sun. What a lovely way to spend an evening.,14-Jun-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"After reading all the rave reviews on Tripadvisor, my wife and I decided to visit Eiffel and we couldn't be happier with our decision. The atmosphere in the restaurant was incredibly warm and honest. The food was fresh and bursting in flavour! We were warmly greeted by Fernando and promptly ushered to our table. As we spoke very little Spanish, Fernando kindly provided an English translation in print. With his help, we ordered empanadillas (must try), grilled prawns, calamari and mushrooms. The dishes were simple and unpretentious, whilst the quality of ingredients used were top-notch. The grilled calamari was crisp on the outside, smooth and juicy on the inside. Hands down the best grilled calamari we have ever had. The mushrooms were served with thinly sliced cured ham and a healthy dose of garlic and olive oil. Yum! We also enjoyed the most amazing acorn dessert wine and orange sorbet drink after dinner.  Eiffel's food, service and atmosphere made for an excellent dinner. Miguel and Fernando could not have done more to make us feel welcome at this lovely family-run establishment. We will definitely visit again.",13-Jun-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"OK...it's out of the way...on arrival it looks like a service station......BUT........get yourself in a cab.....see a bit of Madrid on the way and when you get there, experience a warm and friendly welcome and a tasting menu that is as innexpensive as it is lovely. Spend some time in the bar outside to soak up some lively atmosphere and you'll feel you've had an experience not to be missed. On the tourist beat? No....even more special....a hidden gem. Thank you Miguel and your family",8-May-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"This is a family owned/run restaurant, Miguel told us that his father started the business and his mum is the chef. It was our last meal in Madrid just before our flight home and we spent 2 hours in the sun enjoying wonderful food with a bottle of cava. It was exactly how we wanted to end our trip to Spain. We even bought a kg of the Cecina de Le√≥n en Carpaccio which is beef and Miguel sliced it and packed it into 100gm packs vacuumed sealed for the plane. We were there for lunch and we arrived at 12.30 (early for lunch in Spain), even though the inside of the restaurant was empty, we were told that it was fully booked so we took a table outside. As we were eating, the restaurant filled up quickly with locals (always a good sign) who were there for their weekend family lunch. I recommend the tasting menu which is very reasonable for 21.50 each, everything is good and good portions. If I am ever back in Madrid, I will definitely come back for a visit.",2-May-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We went to Eiffel on the tripadvisor reviews. Really nice food, and affordable. We ended up having the tasting menu for ‚Ç¨21. The oxtail was so good that we could have had just that! It's a bit out of the way though.",30-Apr-16

Eiffel,5,Positive,"This is a really long review, but there's a reason why I would go to such lengths to write it.  We arrived at Eiffel rather early compared to the usual dinner time, yet the waitress still attended to us. Although she couldn't speak English, and we couldn't speak Spanish, we manage to overcome the language barrier using Google translate and her recommendations were superb! It was only sometime later that we found out she was the cook alongside with her mother! For starters, we had the Cecina cured ham, crunchy chicken salad, and the empanadillas casera. All three starters were magnificent and that's only the beginning. We later had 350 grams of well cooked steak (entrec√¥te) and also the homemade oxtail stew. The fat of the steak melted like butter and the meat was juicy! The oxtail meat was tender and soft, whereas the stew had burst of herb flavours with carrots and onions and seemed to be the savoury nectar of heaven. Besides that, we had the grilled pork ears which were amazing! The dinner was then finished off with two scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with generous amounts of strawberry sauce and also their homemade custard which was sprinkled with cinnamon powder. We were also given tangerine sorbets which were on the house and was a perfect end for a dinner in summer. Looking at the bill in the end, the price of the food were reasonable and definitely bang for buck for quality and quantity!  Thank you to previous TripAdvisors who voted this to be the best restaurant in Madrid! Clearly well deserved with their excellent service and well cooked homemade food!",8-Jul-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,I had engaged in an email conversation with Miguel where I flip flopped between dates prior to arriving and was delighted to be personally greeted with a warm smile when I finally arrived. My personalized table reservation notice will be proudly exhibited when I return to my office in China and I inflicted friends and family with photos of it framed by the monstrously large gin and tonic and selection of scrumptious tapas. A great late afternoon treat! Everything was delicious and the coffee flan (??) at the end was sumptuous. Well worth the effort but it might be a good idea to make reservations as Miguel reports that business is very brisk. The usual neighbourhood families are still there but he is now meeting and feeding visitors from around the world.,8-Jul-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Here is how to get to Madrid's most-recommended restaurant: If you are somewhere in the city centre, you'll want to Metro number 10, probably from Plaza de Espana. Hop out at Casa de Campo and Google map iot from there. It's about a ten-minute walk, and you have to make something of a loop. As you walk away from the Metro station, it is best to be on the right hand side of the road - there is less hassle getting under the bridge that way. As a number of reviewers have already said, Eiffel doesn't look like much. It's the most unassuming place you could imagine. Some people may even be tempted to turn around and sneak away. Don't do it! You're in for a real treat. This is excellent, straightforward, wonderfully-cooked food which you'll be grinning about all the way back home. The service is terrific - the staff here will look after you even if your Spanish is as bad as ours - and will go out of their way to make your visit memorable. As far as value for money is concerned, you could not ask for more. Go visit - you'll feel like you had a small adventure, and a big taste experience.",29-Jun-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Eiffel is a very ordinary looking restaurant hidden away amongst tower blocks in Madrid's suburbs. In the unlikely situation you were wandering along the road you wouldn't give it a second glance. However step inside and the staff greet you like an old friend. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome, encourage you to taste the dishes they have built their reputation on and smile with the genuine warmth of people who really love what they do. I chose the 'bull tale (sic) stew', which was tasty, tender and very filling. When I decided not to have a dessert, the waiter immediately went and got me a small lemon sorbet on the house. This place is remarkable simply because the whole experience is worthy of remark. You leave with a smile on your face and want to mention it to everyone you meet.",28-Jun-15

Unfortunately I had to rely on a translation for the menu but they are in the process of creating a menu in several languages as the restaurant becomes more and more popular! Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment!! ,21-May-15

We put our faith in him and let him bring our dinner.It was the perfect amount of food and the wine which was only 10.50 E was great! We recommend letting them order for you. The chef is the owner and has been cooking there for 50 years and her son makes a great dessert. Just a great experience we will remember forever.",20-May-15
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor however there were no reviews in English. My wife and I thought we would give it a try. After catching a train and walking for 10 minutes in suburbia we found our destination. Aren't we glad we came. The food was delicious and the service was the best we've had. The owner and his staff member (Fernando) were friendly, welcoming and ever so helpful with helping us selecting our meal. We asked for traditional dishes and they cooked us crispy chicken salad, risotto and pig ears. All three were culinary delights. Although the pig ears at first didn't sound great they were surprisingly delicious and tender. It's a restaurant I would hope all visitors and locals to attend. Top marks from me. Thank you for having us!!! Cannot wait to come back!",5-May-15

Eiffel,5,Positive,Went to Eiffel today. What a Great experience. Would love to go there again. Big thanks to Miguel and the rest of the family...,21-Mar-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"You go here to take a break from the hustle of Madrid. A typical looking Spanish neighborhood meson, but much more than that. We had the tasting course lunch at fix price. Very appealing and tasteful, like a 3 Michelin star presentation for a fraction of the cost. Limited wine selection but good. The host waiters are outstanding in service and explanation of all courses. I've lived in Spain and this is old world simple respectful dining, nothing fancy and very comfortable atmosphere. To me this is normal Spain dining with enjoyment, for other new comers it may be unbelievable. This is why I keep coming back to Spain, no other country in Europe comes even close to the down to earth hospitality. The location is quite a bit far, but can take the Metro line 10 to Casa de Campo to save on taxi fare. You will be happy you tried. Please make a reservation even though not required.",29-Feb-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We wanted to buy a voucher as a gift for our son to have a nice meal out in Madrid where he lives. Having read the reviews we contacted a few restaurants and Miguel from Eiffel inspired us the most. Efficient and friendly, he went out of his way to help us despite our having no Spanish! He produced a gift voucher online, we paid by transferring into the account and the gift was duly handed over and well received by our son. He went there last night and has sent us rave reports and photos of their meal. I also received a charming email from Miguel with a photo! Suffice to say we can't wait to go there on our next visit - we already feel part of the family!",19-Feb-16

I have to say that I have been a little detractor of Spanish food as I usually don't see any effort on the dishes coming but this restaurant made my opinion up to traditional food.

Eiffel,5,Positive,"We called the same day to make reservations as we didn't want to take a cab there and then not have a place to sit down to eat. The owner who spoke to my husband was very kind and assured us he would have a table reserved for us. When we arrived we noticed there was seating outdoors, in a little bar area, and then a private little dinning room. As we got to our table there was a little printed sign with our name on it that said reserved...very personal and sweet. We were greeted by our server who took excellent care of us all night? He spoke in Spanish and English when needed. He brought out some delicious bread with what they call ""liquid gold""...olive oil. yum! We ordered all kinds of stuff and we were just amazed by the taste and presentation. My hubby had the spinach and cheese empanadas which were amazing! I had the fried shrimp with the wasabi mayo....probably some of the best tasting shrimp I have ever had! For our entrees we had the lamb and the Rabo de Toro Estofado. Both were prepared perfectly...loved their potatoes too! The owner Miguel came to speak to us towards the end to make sure all was too our liking and was kind enough to call a taxi for us when we were ready to go. We loved this place so much that on our last night in Madrid we decided to go back! We were treated like family and our server Fernando took great care of us again. the quality of the food and is worth every penny and more...highly recommend if you are in the area...looking forward to returning one day! thanks!",8-Jul-16
Eiffel,4,Positive,"The service was very good and the staff very friendly. The presentation was excellent and creative on most courses. I tried the 8 course tasting menu. At 21 euro it was a good deal by any objective standard. Everything was beautiful and creative and tasted good, but not excellent or special. All the food tasted very traditional and well prepared but was made to look more spectacular by it's impressive presentation. I have no complaints at all with the meal, but it was not to the standards of a tasting menu one would expect in a top 10 restaurant. The main dining room was nice, but a bit amateur. Paper place mats and napkins, and such. There was a bar and outdoor seating area and it was full of locals and families. I give them credit for trying to push the envelope and they do present a nice experience for a reasonable price. But if you are accustomed to a 60 euro tasting menu don't expect the same quality of food here. If you want a good traditional meal with a bit of a creative twist at an excellent price, then this is a definite winner.",28-Jun-16
Eiffel,3,Negative,We came because of the recommendations in TripAdvisor. The courses were special. The fish was bad but all the other courses were great. Service was polite and quick. We enjoyed the meal but their toilet was horrible. Filthy and broken. ,8-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"At the risk of piling on, Eiffel is an affordable, fun night of delicious food on the outskirts of Madrid. My wife and ordered 2 appetizers (the calamari is wonderful and you have to try the Gloria Ferrer style tuna) and an entre 'para compartir' the house specialty oxtail stew. With a bottle of delicious Verdejo it was an out of this world dinner for <50 Euros. And you can't beat the hospitality that Eiffel is famous for. Fun experimental night out of Salamanca or Old Town!",8-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Myself and my girlfriend visited here for our 10th anniversary at the end of Sept. What a treat it was. The service was amazing and Miguel the owner made everything very special for us. He even had a photo of us on the screen in the restaurant that my girlfriend provided.  We took recommendations for out starter and had shrimp croquettes, and a salmon and avocado dish, main was lovely -best oxtail ever and fish in cream sauce and the pudding was a special ice cream dessert with our names embossed into the wafers... Drinks were reasonably priced - and we were able to eat alfresco too which was great. The restaurant was a little out of the way - but only a 7 euro cab from our hotel each way. It was a lovely family run place, great value and exceptional service - thank you all sooooo much ",7-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"After reading the reviews for this restaurant on here I decided to book a surprise for my Mother and Father's Anniversary, Miguel asked me for a photo which he displayed on screens in the fantastic modern restaurant,  The food was some of the most creative and tasty food I've ever had, the service was second to none, Miguel was happy to tailor the menu to our requirements as 3 of us wanted the taster menu and the other wanted al la carte.  The restaurant is a short taxi ride from Madrid. All 4 of us had a wonderful evening, A massive thank you to Miguel and his staff for making the occasion a memorable one. ",6-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,We never would've ended up here had it not been for tripadvisor. So glad we did. Our server was excellent. So warm and friendly. Very accommodating and helpful. It's a bit out of the way so we never would've found it had it not been reviewed so well. Uber was about 13‚Ç¨ and the server called a taxi for the return because there was a futbol game and no Uber available outside the city center. Taxi was about the same for the return. The food was outstanding. Not what you would expect from a quaint little neighborhood place. We did the tasting menu and it was amazing which included a plate of 4-5 desserts. I would highly recommend it. Quite a lot of food for the price and the server brought us free drinks after the meal. A neighboring table informed us that is common in places like that to have a drink after dinner. You likely won't get that at a tourist restaurant. We didn't know what we wanted so he brought us 4 glasses with ice and 4 bottles of liquor. He just left them at the table for us to have whatever we liked. This was by far the best meal we had in Madrid. I would not hesitate to go back or recommend the place to anyone. We absolutely loved it.,2-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"This restaurant was definitely worth the short taxi drive out of Marid, the food, the service everything was very good, the whole experience was lovely, we look forward to going again when we are next in Madrid. We'd booked our table thank goodness the restaurant is very popular.",1-Oct-16
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I have visited this wonderful restaurant on many visits to Madrid including small quiet dinners and a wonderful private wedding lunch. The food is always outstanding especially the croquets and the cod. When you eat at Algarabia, you feel like you are dining in the home of old friends. The service is excellent and the wine is outstanding. Isabel and Pilar have become like family, but then they will treat everyone who enters the restaurant like family. I recommend this restaurant highly to any visitior to Madrid or to locals who have not yet tried it. Un verdadero placer!!",21-Aug-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"After 6 years we re-visited Algarabia. What a warm welcome we got from Isabel and Pilar! We felt imediately at home again, like when we visited them the first time. We enjoyed the divine autentic spanish food and of course, the house wine  Thank you very much for the beautiful and fun evening!! We will be back sooner this time.... With a big hug, Angela & Daniel ",29-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Tiny restaurant, charming and silent, like a home. Traditional regional food (from Rioja), very well cooked and presented. Service kind, polite and attentive. Ideal for a couple or friends to relax and be able to talk softly while savoring delicious dishes. Quite fair price.",15-Jan-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,The other reviews are correct; great little place to eat! ‚ú®We had the lunch special and enjoyed the cold beverages. Great service!,28-Jun-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"Amazing is the best word to describe the tasting menu. The quality is of 5 stars, the service is perfect, the taste and the appearance are top of the notch and the price are really reasonable(21E per person). The desert was included. Overall is a lot of food(I'm a big eater). The best place I have eaten in Madrid and one of the best place I have eaten in general. Go here!",21-Jun-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,A mild spring evening sitting outside with excellent attentive staff who spoke English and took seriously my gluten free requirements. The menu caters for all food requirements. The menu was extensive and the food was delicious. Well worth catching a short metro ride out of centre of Madrid to enjoy high quality and friendly establishment.Highly recommended. I shall return next time I'm in Spain. ,2-Jun-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"My friend and I went on a weekday and had the ‚Ç¨10 lunch deal. We went early (by Spanish standards) so there was only a waitress when we got there. She didn't speak English but was so kind to bring us into the kitchen to show us what was on the Spanish menu! Service was impeccable, so genuine, and food was so incredible that we felt awful paying only ‚Ç¨10 per person. The sort of place you really WANT to give a nice tip!! ",21-May-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,We booked this in advance due to the brilliant reviews and were not disappointed. Wonderful food with lots of local dinners. We felt like locals and the price was very reasonable for the quality of food. Brilliant service too. Thank you. ,6-Sep-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We came here on our last night of staying in Madrid. It is a small and very friendly restaurant and we were made to feel so welcome. Our waiter (I think his name was Fernando , sorry if I'm wrong!!) was absolutely fantastic. He gave us recommendations and helped us with the menu  My daughter and I had the tasting menu between us. WELL! What a treat! A starter of 'Tuna Ferraro Rocher' Prawn tempura , and fried black pudding. Then we were brought a plate of Spanish ham , after that , chicken salad , Then a main of Oxtail stew , then a selection of deserts , finished with coffee and then a liqueur. My husband and elder daughter had steak which was just as good. Now , back home in England , I have eaten in 'fine dining' restaurants , but NOTHING compares to the meal we had here at Eiffel. From the warm friendly service , to the quality ,and amazing value of the food. This is not the 'biggest' or 'poshest' restaurant in Madrid , but if you venture out of the city to this modest little restaurant , you will not be disappointed.  Home cooked family food at its best. X",10-Aug-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"My wife and I arrived in Madrid and were tired from the travel. Since we hadn't made any plans for the day except to adjust to the time difference, we decided that we would at least try to find somewhere nice to eat. We discovered Eiffel on trip advisor and thought we would give it a try. We were glad we did.  We had trouble understanding the menu so the server gave me the wifi code so that I could check there website for an English translation. Our server spoke enough English to help us understand what we were ordering. He suggested the oxtail stew which he promised would not disappoint. To his credit he was right. Coming from a Jamaican background it tasted like what I was accustomed to. My wife had the chicken salad that was equally impressive. All his suggestions were fabulous so we decided to trust his judgment when it came to desert. We had a sampler of a few different items and this was also great.  I found that they were very accommodating and extremely friendly. The location of the restaurant was a bit of a distance from where we were staying, but it was well worth it. ",6-Aug-16
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"From the moment you enter Algarabia, you are well taken care of by Isabel, the hostess, and her sister, Pilar, the chef. The food is fabulously fresh, innovative and delicious, and reasonably priced. The service is lovely and not rushed. By the end of the meal, you feel as if you have made new friends. We have now eaten there twice - once for dinner, once for a special wedding luncheon that the sisters threw for our friends. They created a wonderful event and we plan to go back again on our next visit to Madrid.",14-Aug-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The restaurant was recommended by a friend in Madrid and very near our rental apartment near the Opera. What a superb experience! Excellent (and authentic Spanish) food, delicious wines (especially their house labels) and a gracious and wonderfully comfortable atmosphere. The welcome and table service from Isobel combined with the cuisine prepared by Pilar made this easily our best meal in Madrid and a highlight of our five weeks in Europe. Not to be missed and tremendous value. We will be back!",22-Jul-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I discovered this place thanks to some colleagues. Now is a must every time I am in Madrid. The food is very nice, well presented and tasty. The wine list is good, but also the house wine is very nice. The quality/price ratio extremely good. The menu choice is ample enough to push you to come back for the pleasure of exploring what you did not choose the time before, but the quality is so good you also want to enjoy again what you tasted some time before. The best part are the two sisters that are running it, Pilar in the kitchen and Isabel at the tables. They manage to convey a nice elegant atmosphere yet to make you feel at home. At the end of a day is nice to enjoy their excellent food while being entertained by the tales of their trips or discussing the current economical situation. Just like you would do in a dinner with old friends. An experience not to miss.",11-Jul-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"Algarabia was recommended to us and did not disappoint. Our starter, a shared salad bursting with flavor, was followed by wonderful Rioja dishes of oxtail stew and braised lamb. Our bottle of Rijoa wine complemented the meat perfectly. The dinner was made especially delightful with our attentive host, Pilar. We cannot wait to return. Bravo!",30-May-11
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,We went to dinner here for our 20th wedding anniversary mid-May 2019. This small place is run by two sisters. One is the chef and one greets and serves. The food is amazing and the two sisters are fabulous. I highly recommend a visit to this place when in Madrid. ,21-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"Isabel and Pilar are very pleasant people and as a solo diner I do appreciate attention in a restaurant when waiters so often skate over you. The ambience of the restaurant is very pleasant too, though I think most of the customers are foreign. I wasn't terribly impressed with the food however. The helpings were small, my mushroom soup was unseasoned, there were no vegetables with my main course and I left still somewhat hungry. To my mind the restaurant is overpriced for what it is. I was a bit shocked at the bill and I'm afraid the house wine that others rave about is distinctly underwhellming. All of this was a pity because the sisters are so nice. A bit of a damp squib, I'm afraid",21-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Had a complimentary pate to start which was very tasty. We had pork and beef mains which were excellent as was the botlle of house Rioja. Finished with caramel custard and pears in wine. Cost 74 euros. Wasn't the most filling meal we had in Madrid but was the best quality. The two sisters who own/run it were very friendly and helpful.,14-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is a rare gem. It is a restaurant in which you will likely become part of the extended family of the hostess/server Isabel, and the cook, Pilar. Most of the customers have been there before, and return for the unique experience of wonderful food and wonderful people. It's a bit like going to your favorite Aunts' for dinner, wonderful, delicious food prepared and served with love as the main ingredient. The cuisine of Rioja is served, with delicious wine, but the main course is friendship, interest, and affection. Dining with Isabel and Pilar is an unforgetable experience, so I suggest you organize your time in Madrid around availability in Algarabia.",12-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Fabulous things come in small packages. This package is wrapped in priceless wrapping. The food cooked by Pilar, is truly delicious no matter what you order. Isabel will take care of you and treat you like an old dear friend. You will not forget this delicious experience... not to mention these 2 sisters!! This restaurant is like a warm delicious hug!! It is a small place so be sure to make reservations in advance. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d991733-r642907385-Algarabia-Madrid.html#",1-Jan-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This restaurant is run by two charming sisters, Isabel and Pilar, who will remind you of your beloved aunties. Pilar cooks food in the traditional style of La Rioja, where the sisters grew up, accompanied by the restaurant‚Äôs own special red wine from the region. The dining room is cozy and quiet, but brightened by flutters of lovely conversation, especially when Isabel comes by the tables to chat. I recommend Pilar‚Äôs homemade pat√© and anything cooked with mushrooms is sure to be delicious. Seasonal ingredients are always used and cooked perfectly. It is a good idea to order the menu of the day, as you‚Äôll be able to try the best dishes of the season, as long as you‚Äôre open to eating anything. Be sure to reserve a table in advance because the restaurant is well known by both Madrile√±os and travelers who return to dine with the sisters. Look for the raving review of Algarab√≠a in the Cond√© Nast 2019 Travel Guide. This may be the best food in all of Madrid!",22-Dec-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We met friends from Barajas for dinner at Algarabia on a chill and wet evening, happy the restaurant is just steps from the Opera Metro. Isabel greeted us with warm hugs & kisses as we introduced her to our friends as it was their first time dining at Algarabia. She made us feel welcome and special as she showed to our table. Our friend is a pescatarian so we were presented with cheese from Rioja and olives as well as the delicious house pat√© with warm crusty bread to enjoy with a glass of cava. We also enjoyed a shot of rich and creamy clam chowder. We all shared starters of bacalao croquetas, crispy asparagus, salt√© of prawns, mushroom and borage and sauteed artichokes and fava beans. All delicious, beautifully presented and graciously served by Isabel. Our friends both chose the Bacalao a la Rioja and we both opted for the Baked Merluza with orange migas. Both dishes were  cooked to perfection with the fish moist and beautifully seasoned.  We managed to consume two bottles of the excellent house Rioja before it was time for dessert. We shared Soto Pears stewed in Rioja and the Crema Fria with caramel, both satisfying and light to finish our dinner with friends. When Chef Pilar came out to greet her guests she was met with a round of well deserved applause. ¬°Brava! Thank you Isabel and Pilar for making us and our friends feel truly 'como en su casa'.",15-Dec-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"First of all. This is not the usual restaurant with tons of waitresses. What you will find is two owners (sisters and best friends) running the whole restaurant on a personalized basis. What we loved most is that both sisters provide a unique and personalized service. The house wine a Tempranillo is wonderful.  The food is superb. We have the 4 course meal for 38euro. Simply great. The soup, pate, pork and the dessert were insane!  Hugs and kisses from the Puertorrican couple (copa libertadores) to those two wonderful sisters. ",12-Dec-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We ALWAYS! dine at Algarab√≠a our first in Madrid, but this time we went on our final night as well. We are never disappointed and always surprised with the new dishes or off the menu specials Pilar conjures up with her magic in the kitchen.  And then there is the inimitable Isabel.. charming and gracious as she glides around the elegant room, never missing a beat as she pampers her guests. She is also a treasure trove of information on the latest theater plays and museum exhibitions and insider things to do while in Madrid. We have learned from past dinners at Algarab√≠a to trust Isabel's suggestions or to simply put yourself in Pilar's hands and just enjoy as we eat practically anything that walks, flies or swims, just as long it is accompanied by the restaurant's excellent David Moreno Rioja! For us Algarab√≠a has become an event and not just a dining experience as we always manage to meet and share a grand time with other guests as well, always feeling like we are among friends and not just customers.  If you want to experience Riojan cuisine cooked with passion and served with boundless joy then head to Algarab√≠a and be 'swept away' by the Chicas from Rioja!!!",30-Nov-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Is like travelling to a an other dimension.  Local and sophisticated food. The ingredients and the preparation amazing. Isabel and chef Pilar make this  like a house restorant, their open home to host an international crowd.Thanks!",11-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is a special little corner in the old heart of Madrid. Managed by a couple of lovely sisters from Rioja region, food is homemade while new and unique. This evening we tried an amazing lamb cooked with mint at low temperature, it was superb.",10-May-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"A very small restaurant, ran by two elderly sisters. A setting almost like a living room. Quite an extensive menu, given the fact that it is so small. A warm welcome by Isabel, who is caring about the guests, Pilar is the (only) cook. We choose foie gras and quail breast as starters. The foie gras was extremely good and definitely home made, first class! Quail breast was okay, with some ham added to prevent it from getting dry, which unfortunately influenced taste too much. The main course was cod in tomato and oxtail stew. Both dishes were flat in taste and there were no side dishes whatsoever, not even a single leave of lettuce. Dessert was an apple toffee cream, which was good. We ordered some glasses of house wine and a bottle of water with our menu. We paid ‚Ç¨120, which is given the prices of restaurants in Madrid and the food served, simply too much. The ladies really do their best and are super friendly, but the food needs a bit more decoration and taste. A top 100 position among 11000 restaurants in Madrid is absolutely overrated. ",19-Apr-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"Place has the looks of a trattoria, average food but prices of a 4 star restaurant ! Very dissatisfied...",19-Apr-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Assisted by Trip Advisor, we found this lovely little restaurant tucked away right near Teatro Real and the Opera metro station, only a short distance up a small street. Isabel greeted us like old friends, and we also met her sister Pilar after she had cooked our dinner. We chose their house wine, a lovely rioja, and we were served free appetisers of pate and soup before the three delicious courses we ordered. Isabel was attentive and friendly, even as the restaurant filled, and both sisters posed for photos after the wonderful meal. These two seemed to manage this restaurant without any stress, and experiencing their open friendliness and warmth are part of the reason we travel!",15-Jan-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Writing this review is kind of easy: select any of the previous ones that thought this place was excellent, read them all, and that's it. You are all set. What can I write that hasn't been written before? Yes it's a two women operation, small cozy little restaurant, with Rioja-style Spanish specialities, lots of fresh ingredients brought to them specially and directly by the producers, with a personal attention up to every detail, and a familiar ambience it will make you fill at home (in a real good way, like Anton Ego while visiting Gusteau's restaurant in Ratatouille, trying Remys cooking for the first time!) Isabel, Pilar: we will come back!",29-Nov-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We chose this restaurant for our anniversary dinner and were extremely happy with our choice. We dined in a cosy, romantic atmosphere, facilitated by the owners who decorated our table with little red hearts and lights (a nice small gesture which makes a difference). The food was ‚Äùhome-made‚Äù, fresh and tasty. The service polite and friendly. 5 points without hesitation.",25-Nov-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"ALGARAB√çA is one of my fixed and unmissable stops in Madrid. This time it was twice in four days, as the first dinner was so delicious that we decided it was worth a second wonderful experience. Isabel and Pilar pampered us so well that the only thing we could do was to go again. This tiny cozy place is a little food paradise of Rioja cuisine.  Had the dishes of the days, first the beans soup, a delicate mixture of beans and herbs, and the second time a wonderful dish of artichokes and a perfect lentil soup, followed by tripes and cod for my friend, having already tried the squids in onion mixture two days before. One world: Estupendo. Chocolate lamina and pears in red wine where our desserts. Simply unmissable but do reserve as they can only host 20 lucky guests. A round of applause for Isabel and Pilar, as always",15-Nov-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"I‚Äôm a foodie and expected excellent food due to the restaurant‚Äôs high rating but was disappointed.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Recommended by some colleagues, this restaurant even exceeded our expectations. The owner, Marcos, explained in detail all the dishes and recommended excellent food and wine, salmon, artichokes, cannelloni, steak tartare, chicken,... everything was excellent!!!! Great service and great wine recommendations, will certainly come back!",17-Nov-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Just go here! Everything so well prepared and the simple yet wonderful tastes is a part of the genuine Madrid tastes. Very nice wines too!,8-Feb-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This is simply my favorite restaurant in Madrid (and I've lived here for 7 years) - the food is very simple but excellent, but it's much more the wonderful treatment you receive. I am celiac, and therefore a ""fussy"" orderer - but here, there was almost nothing on the menu I couldn't eat. We were waited on by the owner, who was extremely knowledgeable about every ingredient in every dish. He suggested delicious wine pairings for each plate we had, was exceptionally kind, helpful and attentive, and made sure we had an unforgettable, romantic, relaxing dinner. It was also quite extraordinarily reasonably priced. I really can't recommend it enough!",16-Jul-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"When we arrived the owner took time to explain the menu and gave us two wines to taste to help us select one. The menu was not huge but everything sounded great, so it was hard to choose. After the house appetiser of potato my husband had a tomato based soup and I chose the confit of leeks. We would have tasted each other's dishes but the owner served the soup in two bowls so we each had half the serving. Similarly, we each had a plate so we could both have some leeks. For main course I had cod and my husband had octopus then we finished with a serve of ice-cream. The food was delicious, especially the leeks. It was a memorable dinner and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Of note, it is a small restaurant so a booking is essential to guarantee a table.",11-Oct-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This place is small and humble from the outside, however once inside the owners passion for food is infectious. In a city overflowing with great restaurants, the X factor required is in the small details, and the fact that the owner greets every table, he is also the chef and personally chooses the days produce daily, speaks volumes.  The food and wine were all top quality, with a special mention to the salmon gravelax style with mustard. TBE A must visit on a trip to Madrid ",11-Aug-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We had a fantastic meal at Vinoteca Morat√≠n.  Owner and chef Marcos Gil served up the freshest produce from the local market, an extremely warm and descriptive run-through of the local produce along with wine pairings to go with. Our favorite dinner while in Spain.",2-Aug-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Exceptional- they really take care to cook the freshest ingredients for us.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"My husband is celiac(no gluten) and 90% of the menu was gluten free.  Perfect food, wine, and the staff are lovely. But make sure you reserve because it is a small cosy restaurent (maybe 35-40 places at most). No outside patio.  Tomatoes are in season try the cold soup ( not gluten free) or plain tomatoes (gluten free) yummy! We had Salmon (gluten free) very tasty and cannelloni so perfect (not gluten free), unctuous.  Wine recommendation was fantastic.  We will come back here for sure. ",14-Jul-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"My family and I chose this restaurant because of the reviews and also because they open a little earlier than a typical Madrid restaurant - our reservations were for 7:30PM. We started with the leeks and steak tartar, both excellent choices. 2 of us had one of the daily fish specials, the red mullet which was quite tasty. My brother had the Canelones and was pleased with his choice. We ended with the Cr√®me guemada. Through all this we shared 2 bottles of wine. Apps, entrees, dessert, wine, bread and water all added up to about 50E per person so a good value compared to restaurant prices at home. The service was excellent! We all would highly recommend this restaurant, just make sure you make reservations as it is a small but very intimate space.",28-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"During our visit to Madrid, I searched for dinner options and read very good comments about this place. We needed to make a reservation since the place is small and always busy. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to return the day after.Every dish was delicious. The tomato soup was incredible, the artichokes, the cauliflower puree with mushrooms, the fish, and the home made cannelloni... the chocolate desert is a must try. The wine list is very good! We tried a wine we had never tasted before, and asked for the same one the day after. I definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Madrid.... make sure you make a reservation in advance!",25-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Best place to eat in Madrid....staff is phenomenal as well, Everything we had was great and very reasonable (5 people 247 euros!!!).  We had puerros confitados, pulpo, bacalao, pollo de corral al albari, plato del dia, wonderful wine etc etc. It was amazing. My family all agreed it was great. We have eaten here before a couple of times and they remembered my wife and I!

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I have been wanting to go to this place for so long, but it's hard to get a booking. Eventually we went and I had the nicest meal I have ever had in Madrid. The dining room itself is beautifully presented, with vases of lilies, and lovely lighting (it's so hard to get a well-lit dining room in Madrid - most places are so bright!). The tables are not too close together, so there's a very pleasant hum in the room, and the waiters talk at a low volume. It just felt so peaceful compared to the fun but very noisy atmosphere in the vast majority of restaurants here. We ordered a few of the specials (amazing artichokes and porcini mushrooms) and a few of the regulars (the leeks and the steak tartare). The specials were absolutely delicious, and the steak tartare was a dream; I personally didn't find the leeks too interesting, but I know other reviewers liked them. We had lovely pinot noir to accompany (the wine by the glass availability is fab), and a good cheesecake and chilled port (not easy to get in Madrid) to finish. The waiters were lovely, and the chef was so incredibly nice. It's also very good value. Well done on your beautiful restaurant and to all your staff!",18-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This is one of those restaurants where you need to book a table if you want to get a table for dinner. The owner Marcos was very welcoming, taking time to fully explain the menu. We had an absolutely delicious meal, especially enjoying the leek starter. We were given the opportunity of trying a couple of wines to help us choose a bottle of wine. It was certainly a very enjoyable birthday meal. I would certainly return if I was in that area again.",16-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,"This is a place to try! Tomato soup was great, the bacalao amazing!! And dessert was yummy. The only thing I wish I knew was they give you bread with out asking, they charge you for it. The cost wasn't bad at all I just like to know a head of time.",15-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,1,Negative,"Llegamos mi mujer y yo a eso de las 14:30. El local vac√≠o completamente salvo por una mesa ocupada por una pareja y otra pareja que estaba en la barra. Nos preguntan al entrar qu√© deseamos y le indico al camarero que quer√≠amos tomar dos vinos. El camarero, muy amablemente nos informa de que la barra es muy peque√±a, que hay dos personas esperando mesa y que no tenemos sitio para quedarnos. Miro, veo todas las mesas vac√≠as menos la de la pareja que he comentado. Total, nos fuimos. Habiamos visto la carta desde fuera pero no nos dieron opci√≥n a pedir nada. Pienso que al ver que no ten√≠an clientes quer√≠an cerrar pronto y marcharse a su casa. No creo que un local as√≠ pueda mantenerse por mucho tiempo, sobre todo porque hay sitios bastante m√°s atractivos en la zona. My wife an I arrived at 14:30. The restaurant was nearly empty, only a couple of customers were sat having lunch and two girls in the bar. The waiter asked to us what want we to order. I answered him we want to have two red wines. The waiter kindly answered us that the bar is small and there're are two people waiting for having lunch, so we couldn't remain there. Surprisely, I've a look to the restaurant and the whole of the tables except the one on which the couple were sat were vacances. So, my wife and I come out from the restaurant. Before coming in my wife and I have had a look to the published menu but we hadn't the choice to order anything. In my opinion, they wanted to shut early because there weren't enought customers. I don't think a restaurant like this may survive for a long time, moreover because there're more attractive restaurants in the neighborhood",23-Mar-13

A very intimate ambiance make it a great stop to indulge.  The menu is simple but with a good selection. We had a great tomato cream soup, monkfish livers, fresh hake with asparagus. The food is incredibly simple and tasty. Bread, Cheese, Olive oil were all great. Desserts were already over and ice creams can improve.  The wine list is wide and with great picks both Spanish and International plus a top service with great tips.  A lot of attention and professionalism on the service.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Cozy place with fresh and excellently prepared dishes. Great selection of wines. Service excellent. Owner very personable and offered great suggestions. Staff was attentive and very professional. Highly recommend and will certainly go again on my next visit to Madrid.,4-Jul-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,This restaurant is small but the food is fabulous and the service is just as good. The menu is limited but good choices. The servers explain the dishes very well. Good wine. One of us had the roasted chicken served with potatoes. Ate every bite. The other had marinated salmon with a vegetable relish. It was delicious. The salmon was very fresh and high quality. You could tell all the servers were very proud of the quality food. I would make a reservation because it is so small. ,23-Jun-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The food, atmosphere, and service is absolutely amazing. This is one of the best meals I have ever had. The food is simple and prepared perfectly. We highly recommend making a reservation - don‚Äôt miss out on this restaurant.",14-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Isn‚Äôt is wonderful when the glowing reviews you have read prior to visiting a restaurant turn out to be an understatement! This restaurant and the owner Marcos are everything we had read previously and more. We decided to go at lunch time and arrived just as they were opening. Lucky us! Since we were the only ones there Marcos spent a great deal of time explaining dishes on and off the menu. We decided we wanted to try them all and he made smaller portions of 5 items. We started with an amazing tomato soup that tasted like eating a fresh tomato in season. It was followed by winter baby artichokes and leek confit with romesco sauce (his own version with hazelnuts and almonds). The fish of the day was red mullet cooked sous vide and carmelized with a torch. Marcos saved the best for last - to die for porcini mushrooms. We topped it off with a Crema Quemada Catalana, a lighter and less sweet version of Creme Br√ªl√©e which we shared. I only wish I didn‚Äôt have to share it! All in all the best meal of our 3 days in Madrid.",5-Jan-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Marcos, the owner, took time to go over the but interesting menu with us. He also helped us select wines (there are at least 30 by the glass from which to choose) by the offering us tastes of several options along with tidbits of information about each one. The food is fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend. ",30-Dec-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We went to Algarabia with 5 friends, following the warm recommendation of another friend who had recently visited Madrid and went to Algarabia twice within the same week! The restaurant is small and cozy, as you enter you are immediately greeted by Isabel, who makes you feel at home within seconds. Do not hesitate to ask Isabel for recommendations as everything on the menu is simply delicious! We shared 6 starters, which were brought one after the other to allow to focus on each dish properly and avoid jumping on all the plates buffet style! By the end of the starters, we were eagerly waiting for our main courses which were just as good as the rest of the experience until then. We accompanied the food with the house wine, which, like Isabel and her sister Pilar (the chef) is from the Rioja region and made specially for the restaurant. Bottom line: one should really pay a visit to this little hidden gem when in Madrid, beautiful moment guaranteed, food wise and on a human level, makes one remember what restaurant owners who really love what they do can look like and how much you feel the difference in your plate. Corentin",5-Sep-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Do not expect to find a restaurant, because you won't. There you will find two sisters sharing their passion for hospitality and cooking. We were welcomed warmly with my friends and followed the suggestion they made to us. Food from the region of Rioja is amazing, and definitely recommend the house wine. Place not to miss. ",4-Sep-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I'm writing the review while I'm still in the restaurant. That is how much I liked it. Wonderful nice little family restaurant. The typical dishes served here are an amazing experience for your sense. My host, the lady was so nice and friendly. Felt like being home. I was tempt to hug her. You cannot miss this restaurant if you are in Madrid. I can't wait for my next business trip here. Thanks a lot again!!!!!!!",23-Aug-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Isabel and Pilar are the sisters who run this tiny, cosy restaurant in the Plaza Oriente neighborhood. They obviously love what they are doing and makes every diner feel like a welcome guest. The dining room is charmingly cluttered and the menu is hand written. The food was amazing; this dinner was one of the highlights of our trip to Spain. There are only 7 tables, so reservations are a must.",19-Aug-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,We booked an evening meal at this restaurant and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. It felt the most traditional meal we had while in Madrid. The service was perfect and the atmosphere had a great feel.  There‚Äôs an English menu but take the time to learn a little basic Spanish. It‚Äôll help massively and it‚Äôs the least we English can do.  The wine and food were amazing. The pork loin is the best I‚Äôd ever had. Loved the chef coming out to talk when everyone had eaten.  Fully recommended!,11-Aug-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I would call this the best restaurant I have ever been to, it is run by Pilar (the chef) and her sister, Isabel (the waitress.) The good is amazing and the staff and site are extremely welcoming. You are crazy if you don't pick this restaurant for a late dinner meal while in Madrid.",7-Aug-18

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"A charming, tiny restaurant run by 2 sisters - one is front of the house, one is the chef. The food is special, chosen from what is fresh and delicious that day. Their house wine, bottled especially for them, is superb as well. A real find that I highly recommend. They were also very accommodating to special allergy needs.",25-Oct-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I have just returned to Algarabia for a dinner with friends and everyone was enchanted. The beans are to die for! and the pork pretty extraordinary. My friends, who were there for the first time--absolutely loved it.",16-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I have enjoy myself several times in this restaurant and always enjoy a lot. Quality of it's food, lovelly atmosphere and a perfect service offer to their clients high class gourmet experience. Mega Tips:  One: Order as main course a very special pig meat with the name: chumarro. It is serves with sweet onions and I like a lot. Two: Select a house wine that is a Rioja special botteled from restaurant owners and it is taste perfect. Three: They have a dessert that is in my opinion one of best chocolate cake that I never taste. It is based on chocolate, cookies and raspberries. I have visited this restaurant with my love, with friends and family. Always my opinion has been very good.",29-Nov-12
La_Gaditana_Castellana,2,Negative,"We were very unhappy with the food. Everything was very salty, so salty that we couldn‚Äôt feel the taste of what we were actually eating. We were very disappointed, being the first place we ate in Madrid. The two stars are because the sangria was good.  We didn‚Äôt understand the high rating...",25-May-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,1,Negative,Staff delayed bringing desserts by 45 minutes and did not provide a realistic explanation. Taking 15 plates of cake out of a fridge should not take this long. They apologized but only after we complained.,13-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"This was the best meal and experience so far traveling 10 days in Spain. Have used TripAdvisor for recommendations and have been generally pleased. This restaurant has few reviews in English and many more in Spanish. That‚Äôs because this is a neighborhood restaurant that is unpretentious but very welcoming and friendly with terrific and authentic food. For 38 Euros including all you chose to drink their prix fiixed menu is a winner, Five delicious tapas followed by choice of entrec√¥te or oxtail entre followed by desert. Food could not have been better and the service from Juan and Felix was so friendly and attentive that it made for a fun evening. I could not recommend this restaurant more highly and am glad to have a few more days in Madrid before leaving Spain. Muchas, mychas gracias! ",23-Apr-19

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I've been enjoying this restaurant for 3 years now ... and cannot imagine coming to Madrid without a visit ... fortunately, I was able to squeeze in two dinners in this vacation. You'll read in other reviews about the welcome of Isabel and Pilar, the sisters who own the restaurant and will this weekend celebrate their 23rd anniversary... and you'd be correct to think that any restaurant that lasts 23 years must be doing things ""right"" ... hands down this is one of the most gracious warm and welcoming environments I've encountered. they do not try to ""sell up"" on the wine (truly encouraging that unless you're really an aficionado, you'll likely be happy with the house wine ... and wine snob that i sometimes am, I've been quite happy) ... the food is of La Rioja so there are rustic and refined elements ... the salad of duck confit with leeks is wonderful ... my friends loved the croquettes that on this occasion included shrimp (but have in the past varied from jamon to mushrooms to cheese) and last visit we had tasty fresh asparagus wrapped in pastry and roasted .. a fish of the day was one day beautiful blue fish sprinkled with pistachios, another time fresh sardines ... the pork with onion confit is simplicity itself ... the hake/merluza is perfectly cooked and served with purple peruvian potatoes ... and the oxtails speak of long slow braising with some wine and the simplest of seasonings the meals come with a few welcome snacks .. last eve an excellent little portion of phyllo stuffed with morcilla and a mildly spiced tomato sauce on the plate as well as a bit of the lovely house pate ... deserts run from a dark and decadent chocolate/raspberry torte to very sweet apples and caramel creme.  Summing it up, this is not a ""temple"" of food ... this is a space you go to for comfort, welcome, laughs, and a meal that will satisfy on many levels ... and you walk out wondering why there are not more places where the owners make such an effort to make everyone in the room feel like family! Felicidades Isabel y Pilar ... 23 anos! thank you for so many happy memories",1-Aug-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Nice cozy and intimate setting but what sets this place apart are Isabel and Pilar. It is like being at your favourite aunties' place and being fed with the most amazing food! They are both genuinely interested in people and are also very interested in your reaction to the food. We ate there twice 2 weeks apart and we so enjoyed the experience the first time that we immediately booked a table for our return to Madrid. Again the experience the second time was just as amazing. Every single dish that we have had has been quite an experience and we keep reading about the other amazing dishes that we have yet to try! We will be back!!!,21-Jul-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is by far our favorite restaurant in Madrid. It is a tiny gem hidden in the busy area of pedestrian streets not too far from the opera. Two wonderful sisters, Isobel and Pilar, who are from Galicia, run it. Isobel, who is a character in the best way possible, runs the front of the house and she will, with her limited English, guide you through the menu. My meal was like having a Christmas feast in A Caruna - a classic Galician fish dish. She picked a young Rioja wine at reasonable cost and it was just fine. I would write about what my wife had to eat but we can‚Äôt remember anything other than it was fish and it was spectacular. We shared the apple and toffee foam dessert and it was one of the best we have ever had. We got just enough attention from Isobel throughout the meal to feel extremely well cared for and then at the end she brought her sister Pilar out from the kitchen to say hello. If you want to have a delightful and intimate dining experience in Madrid this is the place to go. Very highly recommended!",13-Jul-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,A really small restaurant with a personal touch. Would recommend booking. We had a starter and a main each and all courses were delicious. Also had a bottle of the house red which was equally lovely!,21-Oct-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"An exceptional experience! The restaurant is hidden behind an unassuming door, so we probably wouldn't be able to find it if not for other recommendations on TripAdvisor. We felt as if we were invited to a family dinner - the service was 100% personal, which made the great food taste even better. There was enough choice for each of us, and each dish we ordered was outstanding. Will definitely return next time we're in Madrid!",20-Oct-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"On our second visit, we brought another couple. they raved about the food, service and ambience.We can only concur, it can not get any better. from the pate to our merluza, divine.",16-Oct-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"First, where to start?! Algarabia was an absolute delight from the moment we walked in the door until the moment Isabel walked us across the plaza to the taxi stand. The setting is cozy, intimate and welcoming. The food, incredibly delicious - start to finish - as well as authentic, Rioja-style Spanish. it's a 2 woman operation, Isabel and Pilar, and it is an unbeatable combination of culinary talent, personality and service. We felt we had made new friends by the end of the evening. I agree wholeheartedly with the others who said it was their best meal in Madrid. What a treasure and unexpected authentic experience. Thank you Isabel and Pilar!",6-Oct-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"What a gem of a place to find on Tripadvisor! Run by two sisters, one who cooks in the kitchen and the other who serves; although we met both women. Great choice of food and wish I could have tried more dishes, as each one was better. Loved the duck pate in particular. Only 6 tables on the night we went, with one sitting at 21.30h",30-Sep-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This was the best meal I had in Madrid. The food was delicious, the restaurant was charming and the service was exceptionally friendly. I ended up having 5 courses because I liked my Dad‚Äôs main (squid stew) and dessert (poached pears) so much that I had to order extra portions!! A super experience and if I‚Äôm ever in Madrid again I‚Äôll be back :)",22-Sep-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Algarabia is small venue with the charm of a private dinning room: almost an invitation a catered party in the home of sister proprietors Isabel y Pilar. The food is wonderful the service is so very personal with a genuine interest in you as the patron and now friend. this is a special place in huge city take the time to find Algarabia and enjoy a bottle of the Algarabia 'red' with these fine people.,15-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I got there without a reservation while being on a business trip on my birthday evening. They found me a free table on the spot. everything about the dinner was superb, starting from the great hospitality, their wine and the most amazing dishes you will have. it was one of the best birthday dinner i have ever had",13-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"very small restaurant but charming. Small menu. The food was good but nothing special. There speciality is a grilled filet mignon de  porc, but they served it  really red. We didn't like that. Not cheap.",9-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Staying in Madrid for the weekend between business trips and found this restaurant on Tripadvisor.  Online reservations were very easy.  Small restuarant with eight tables. Very friendly service and an excellent atmosphere.  Had a bean soup and braised pork loin with carmalized onions.  Great place.,5-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This is not a restaurant for passing tourists or those unfamiliar with Riojana cuisine. Over 3 years living here, we have eaten in lots of restaurants and few have succeeded in providing such a charming evening like this restaurant. It opens later than usual restaurants (21.30 hrs) and often you have to buzz to get in as they kept door closed for winter. Inside the violet doors with overflowing ivy over the windows, the atmosphere is almost like a vintage french bistro. Tables are small, decorations are kitsch and antiques. The maitre and cook (sisters) are all there is to the staff of this restaurant. They will both step out to chat if you are there on a less crowded day. The maitre is artistic and considerably well traveled. So in a way the atmosphere is more like being invited to a local vintage collector's home to dine than be guest of a real professional restaurant.  Food wise, we have no complaints at all. The asparagus dish was the highlight and worthy of a trophy on its own. The oxtail stew is one of the softest melt in your mouth in town (trust us we tried a lot). Yet the highlight is the traditional Riojano pork dish.. it's just so heavenly good. Dessert didn't disappoint either even if it's not as sweet or creamy (perhaps designed more for grown ups?). Portions are small but the bread basket and free pate does fill you.  It is not cheap to eat here, however quality wise it's not bad at all (there are extensive listed, starred and recommended restaurants in Madrid that cost more and offer less.. some also listed here). The only thing we didn't like is the house wine which we thought was a little too standard for a Riojano restaurant . We might try the considerably long handwritten wine list next time. We would probably return of course.",6-Nov-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"After quite a few mediocre restaurants in Madrid (there are more of these proportionately than in any other major city we know) three of us had a superb meal at Algarabia.  At a cost of Eu100 three of us enjoyed a delicious Rioja red, and the menu de degustation. The only problem was when the hostess poured my wife a gin and my wife forgot to say ""When"".  The two sisters who run the place are eccentric, but very talented at what they do. The major problem the place has is that it so highly rated on Trip Advisor. People come with overexcited expectations and then are super-critical. The high rating is a function of how disappointing the average Madrid restaurant is.  If I lived in Madrid, this would be a regular for me. As it is I've sent friends there and will visit as and when possible. Come with an open mind and enjoy.",18-Sep-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"Nicely cooked, VERY small portions but the most overpriced restaurant in Madrid (Outside of those on the plazas). Everything was an additional cost, wine list poor and also overpriced. Cosy place and people but others are better value - you can eat at Michelin standard for only a little more. Paid ‚Ç¨90 for two and including a beer and two glasses (small) of wine - Ouch!!",16-Sep-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,We had visited this small excellent restaurant in September 12. Isabel was very kind and laughed all the time. The small talks with her and her explanations of the offers are very good and very amazing. And she is a very nice Spanish lady how knows how to serve her guests. The food was fantastic and delicious and the price was ok.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was very good ... Just one of the high light in Madrid to feel good in a restaurant  Thanks Isabel for the nice evening ... ,13-Sep-12
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"After researching restaurants to celebrate our anniversary, we were lucky to see that a top 10 restaurant was right on our doorstep near the Intercontinental Madrid. We were spoilt for choice on the menu selection and started our meal with a bottle of champagne. The croquettes (we ordered two varieties) were so light and crispy and not greasy, with plenty of flavour. Our mains (Tuna tartar and Iberian Steak) were generous in portion sizes and were also full of flavour. The service was really good too and they surprised us at the end of our meal with a complimentary GnT, what's not to like?! An amazing experience and one I'm happy to give full marks for, well done!",22-May-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,2,Negative,"Nothing was bad to be honest, but almost everything was average. The only thing we enjoyed was the salmon tartar.A rather disappointing experience, as I was hoping much more from this place, considering it was the #2 rated restaurant in Madrid.",21-May-19

La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"This restaurant was recommended by our Concierge as the ""Paella"" supremo...the service was excellent, oysters perfection, calamari enjoyable (different receipe to what we are used to) and Paella was great - we thought the Paella would be full of seafood and although there were some shrimps and calamari with 2 prawns on top...perhaps we ""Lost in translation"" getting the message across that we wanted mussels etc etc. The wines were priced and we enjoyed our evening.",8-May-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Perhaps the best seared tuna I've ever been served.  The ""tomato that wanted to be a star"" will long live in your memory.",7-May-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Had lunch, today's fish, very good, great service, smiling people.

We were celebrating my best friend's birthday. i was a little worried coz she's so complicated with food and places and I was really trying give her the best birthday possible.

La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"Men hi and David did a really good service and they are such a nice staff, as well as Juanjo, who allocated us even with no reservation and full of booking. The food was very good and they invited for a drink and a paella plate. Definitely, very recommended.",6-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,1,Negative,There is NO WAY this is one of the best in Madrid. It's a Tourist Trap beside a motorway. We arrived at 8pm and went inside the main restaurant. They confirm the booking and shunted us outside to their Glass Box which was right beside two busy roads. Eating beside a motorway was NOT what I wanted and inside a glass box was totally awful. We contemplated leaving immediately but it was late and we did not know of an alternative. Food was average. Services was average (tourist level). Overall a terrible experience. Made worse because the main building was a beautiful restaurant which was being kept for later (Spanish) diners - Pushing the tourist early eaters out into the goldfish box. Take a look at by photos to see the reality. Awful and would NEVER go Back nor recommend this place.,2-Jun-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We were looking for a restaurant close to the Intercontinental Madrid and found this restaurant directly across the street.

The start tomato is full of flavor, and perfect half dry with goat cheese. The pouch egg with mushroom is also great with bread ( bigger serving than I thought ). Tuna was prepared in front of us. The Hake was very flavorful with sauce. Our server was great, super cheerful personality, and helpful. A bit limited of English, but who cares, you are in Spain. Having trouble to communicate is part of the vacation.",18-Apr-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,3,Negative,"This was my second choice for dinner after the first didn't serve until 8pm and I was too hank marvin to wait that long. I cant really fault the food. I had poached egg & truffle pasta to start and then the blow torched red tuna for the main. Both were tasty and a level of preparation was done in front of me.  I asked to see the wine list but instead was brought an open bottle of Rioja and had it poured whilst being told it was the 'house' wine. Not really sure what that was about and the first time anyone has made an assumption I don't want to choose what I drink before.  Overall it's not a bad restaurant. The service aside from the wine debacle was good, price is reasonable, the food is tasty and location wise it's convenient. I just wasn't blown away which for somewhere rated so highly I would have expected to have been. ",11-Apr-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,3,Negative,"Based on reading all the amazing tripadvisor reviews, booked this restaurant for one evening during a short trip to Madrid.  Menu now available in English. Ordered the mixed fried fish starter... good but maybe too much fried fish for two people! Main course, ordered the tuna and 30-day aged steak. Tuna was good, but need to order some accompaniments. Steak was enormous, probably only ate 40% of it as quite grissly and fatty, but still got a good amount of good medium-rare meat for your money.  Service was mediocre. May have had high expectations based on the reviews. However could be improved. Experience may be different depending on who you were looked after by. ",5-Apr-19

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"And here we are again, my third wonderful dinner in this little cozy restaurant, where Isabel and Pilar will pamper you, Isabel serving at the table and Pilar creating her wonders in the kitchen. As usual, the service is impeccable but friendly and the food is really prepared on the spot. Nothing is pre-cooked, so you may have to wait 10 minutes, but it is absolutely worth waiting... Pat√® and croquettes as appetizers, (the croquettes filling changes every time..) a wonderful fruity white wine, the chumarro with onions, the sardines with pistachios and tomatoes, , the crunchy chocolate, the caramel cold cream..  When you want to pamper yourself, do choose this place, you won't be deceived",12-Sep-18

The maitre de and chef are sisters (both of whom we got to meet in the course of the night) who are warmly welcoming. We shared entrees - ham, croquettes, pate - all delicious. For main course, chicken, pork, fish and sardines - my son described the chicken as ‚Äúthe best chicken he had ever eaten‚Äù. All the food was excellent (my pork was outstanding). Good wine by the glass - no one had room for dessert. Well worth a visit.",11-Sep-18

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This wonderful respite, a short 5 minute walk from the Palace, was the highlight of our trip to Madrid. A superb bottle of wine, accompanied by asparagus in phyllo pastry, tomatoes stuffed with foie and veal, and a very earthy and succulent plate of esgargots, rioja style, provided an excuse for a 2 hour lunch in the delightful company of Isabel and her sister, Pilar (aka the chef). The restaurant is very intimate and conducive to long conversations. I would definitely return.",29-Dec-12

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"So I was wandering around Plaza Mayor by myself looking for a place to have dinner at 23:30 (I love Spain). I opened my trusty Trip Advisor City Guides app and did a quick search of the area. Algarabia was ranked sixth in Madrid, it was close by and the reviews touted it as a place for locals. Just my style.  The restaurant did not disappoint. As many reviewers have noted, the host, Isabel, is a sweetheart. Despite my very limited Spanish and her limited English we managed some conversation. She made sure I was aware that Algarabia is a real ""Riojana"" restaurant. Eventually she asked how I had heard about it and I showed her the Trip Advisor app. When I explained that Algarabia was the 6th ranked restaurant in all of Madrid she was very excited. I showed her a review that mentioned her by name and she brought one of the other patrons over to translate for her. I think we made her night.  The food was rustic and wonderful. I started with the green salad with leeks and ham and went with the stewed oxtail for the main course. Both were delicious. The dressing on the salad was just right and the oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth tender, topped with a brown sauce and potato hay. Isabel recommended a nice Rioja wine (2004 Vobiscum, from Bodega David Moreno). A great wine at 36 Euro and perfect with the oxtail. For dessert I took Isabel's advice and had a wedge of dark chocolate and rasberry on a cookie crust. Isabel said ""No spoon. Eat like pizza,"" so I picked it up and took a big bite. Delicious! The bitter dark chocolate was offset nicely by the rasberry and sweet cookie crust.  On my way out Isabel introduced me to Pilar, her sister and the chef. I promised I would add my own review to Trip Advisor. So here you are, Isabel and Pilar. Thank you for a wonderful meal and for making me feel at home in Madrid. Mucho Gusto and Hasta Luego.",14-Dec-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The owner is quirky and a delight. We tried to order a tinto de vernao and she said ""no, it¬¥s too touristic, i will bring you something better"" which was hilarious. Food was 100% delicious.",13-Sep-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My husband and i were looking for a close restaurant to our hotel and found this top rated gem on TA. We were so happy we chose this place. It was truly an experience. The owners (two sisters: one the cook and the other the hostess/waitress) were absolutely delightful and so attentive and appreciative of your patronage. We chose to both get the acting menu for 35euros/person. We were certainly happy with the menu and especially loved the asparagus, croquettes, and the pork loin was amazing. The menu also included two desserts which were a nice treat. We both ordered wine, red and white and the house selection was quite good-both coming from the Rioja region. We recommend checking out this intimate locale. you won't be disappointed!",7-Sep-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Reduced menu but high quality food. Croquetas and asparagus are a must eat. Wonderful cold pasta with gulas and garlic. The two owners are lovely and entertained the night. Feels like you are dinning in a friend's restaurant.,31-Aug-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"A perfect setting for a wonderful meal, tucked away in a small road near Opera. The hosts were very welcoming with a useful grasp of English. The food and wine selection was first class.",28-Aug-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This is a delightful little restaurant in central Madrid with a friendly and gentle host. You have dinner in a intimate but at the same time cheerful ambient, a place that you will not have any hurry to leave.  You can find a lot of typical dishes in the menu, based on both meat and fish, carefully cooked. The list of wines is worth a visit too. What struck me the most though is a simple typical Spanish plate like the croquetas, I found good ones in dozens of places around Spain but never so good like these.",22-Aug-12
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"In the northwest corner of Salamanca, you step down from street level into a brightly lit dining room. La Gaditana (derived from the latin origin of the town of Cadiz), specialises in seafood and Andalusian cuisine. We therefore shared the seafood rice dish (think paella) which was wonderful, rich in flavour with the fish and seafood cooked perfectly. There is a good and well-priced wine list to choose from and a large range of menu options to suit all tastes. Service was good and overall the experience met the expectation of this highly-rated restaurant. Highly recommended.",30-Apr-19

La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"I was in Madrid for 1 week on business travel. Was checking for dinner options near my hotel, Barcelo Emperatriz, and came across this restaurant which was a walking distance from the hotel. Loved the ambiance. The food and service was also superb. I requested for an English menu, but they only had the Spanish one. But my host, Senhor Driss, went out of his way to explain the menu and suggested that I try the fish catch of the day. He showed me the fresh fish catch which was brought in a tray so that I could choose my fish. Selected the Sea Bass which was accompanied by grilled vegetables. The fish was brought to my table and Sr. Driss de-boned the fish like a pro. Absolutely loved the fish. Also tried the dessert and was offered a complementary gin at the end.  Would recommend this restaurant.",29-Mar-19

Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"We stopped here for a drink simply because it was close to our hotel, but on seeing other people's food, which looked great, & with such a good service from Momo we were able to reserve a table to return within the hour. Food was really tasty & Momo was happy to recommend a dish when I was struggling to decide between two. Great value for money, especially given the standard of food & v. generous drinks measures!",10-Sep-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"We arrived as a large group, with two children, in two prams. We couldn't have been made more welcome. The service was snappy and we used 'The Fork' to book, so the price was incredible. The food was also a high quality and very tasty. Would recommend.",4-Aug-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Whilst we had to wait a bit for a table to free up, it was worth it. Such a nice surprise to have such delicious Greek food in Madrid. We particularly liked the Veg menu. Prices were reasonable. This is a good spot if you feel like something a bit different. And the service was quite friendly too.",21-Jul-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Nice discovery.We tried the Greek mezzes with some Greek salad and an amazing bread - just great. Service was nice, but a bit slow, however the restaurant seemed fully booked with many locals.",10-Jul-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Table of 7 plus 2 babies. We called the day before to book a table, since the place is rather small. They had no problem and arranged a good table for us, we were comfortable and well seated. The food was good, we shared the appetizer's dish (very good), the octopus (a little chewy) and the feta cheese (very good). Then each of us had a main dish, with good quality overall. The biggest drawback? The place is very noisy, since there's no sound dampeners of any kind, and that gives a lot of echo.  The staff was extremelly helpful and, overall, it wasn¬¥t expensive at all.",10-Jun-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,Had the menu of the day. it was absolutely delicious. Excellent traditional Greeek food absolutely superb. Would not hesitate to recommend. on a four day visit was definately the best meal by a country mile.,26-May-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,"The food was of poor quality: old smelly seafood and the fried cheese seemed to be made out of plastic.  Quantity is small. In fact, no value for money. No wonder the rest is empty :(",12-May-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,Been to Madrid twice and made a point to go to Dionisos both times. If you're in the mood for Greek food do give this a try!,13-Jun-15

Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"We stumbled upon this restaurant, the amber coloured bottle display grabbed our attention. Went in the next day and they squeezed us in for an 830 seating.. So happy we did, the food was amazing - no complaints. the grilled chicken in the mustard sauce was to die for, then dessert ...omfg...get the platter with like five samples of dessert on a plate. For two persons shared starter, two main courses and shared dessert platter and two drinks (soft) about 35 euros.",9-May-12
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We tried this restaurant on a whim after spending the previous day in the touristy section of Madrid. The restaurant was delightful! Our waiter Mihai was attentive, helpful with suggestions and patiently explained the varied flavors of several different dishes. We were treated to a generous bowl of delicious olives and an octopus canap√©. Our dinner entree was fish prepared Andalusian style. Dessert was a delightful blackberry yogurt cake that was extremely light and flavorful. Truly a memorable meal.",21-Aug-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"This is a nice place if you want to eat Greek food in Madrid. I already went a couple of times and I really enjoyed both times. I would say it is maybe for an special occasion rather than just casual dinner. I mean, be prepared to pay around 20-25 per person. Anyways, this is nowadays the average price for a good dinner in Madrid. Food is delicious though. They have a great variety of dishes, all very tasty. ",11-May-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Splendid experience at Dionisos restaurant!!! That day I truly wanted to try Greek food, and according many reviews on that restaurant, the food and environment is veryy tradional greek one, and it was!! I am so happy I had this experience, the food was perfect, so tasty, looked delightful and the portions were really huge! we stuffed our bellies like insane.. And the quality, taste and prices were extremely satisfactory. The staff was ok, actually, quite busy, but still friendly and nice. Very recommend for people who have never tried greek kitchen! And for those who want to full theirs bellies over the top!",26-Sep-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"We found this restaurant by chance on our first night in Madrid. We had a very nice dinner, and we were really satisfied.

To be recommended !",30-Apr-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,I am Greek and I can definitely recommend this restaurant. We had an excellent traditional Easter diner!,15-Apr-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,This is not a bad restaurant. Location superb in Chuecha. We had mezzes. Everything was ok but nothing special. But if you are tired of Spanish tapas this is a good alternative. Staff and owner very friendly.,18-Oct-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,We just spent 2 weeks in Greece and wanted the real food again. Yes it is real Greek food service was great and the food was like we were back on the island  very tasty,12-May-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"My wife and I found this place from a tour book and were glad. The waiter was friendly, and the food was excellent. The d√©cor is adequate, and we were not expecting much. If you want a change of pace and Greek is your desire, this is a very reliable place to satisfy your taste buds.",2-May-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"The restaurant is OK, in general. The staff was just fine: some waiters were good but another one was too much friendly and crossed the line from nice to annoying. The food is just fine, I missed some spices, but the starters were better than main courses. The place is crowded and the tables are too close from each other. However, it was not very expensive. A place to step in if you find it, but not exciting enough to look for it.",27-Apr-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"Nice decor, pleasant and helpful staff to start. Great wine. Lousy lamb chops. Extremely thin and full of grizzle and small bones in addition to the expected one.. The pile of remnant on the plate exceeded the amount consumed. I made mention of this to the waitress and suddenly her ability to communicate in English vanished. Others who did not have lamb chops seemed pleased.",26-Apr-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,We had a girlie lunch here and were not disappointed. It is tiny and very cosy. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty. Lots of healthy options on the menu. Very good value for central madrid. Hidden down a back street it is well worth finding.,20-Mar-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,friendly. best for menu 0f the day.it took us time to understand the menu- maybe because we were looking for pasta. looks like locals were sitting there for their lunch.,15-Jan-15

Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,5,Positive,"Went for brunch with friends on a weekend away. This is a hidden treasure; a rooftop terrace with stunning views, great atmosphere and so comfortable we stayed for 3 hours. Sadly we don't speak Spanish but the waiters were so friendly and patient with us. Ariel in particular was a dream! The food and drinks were delicious, our only regret was there was so much we couldn't finish it all! We paid ‚Ç¨30 each for a 2 course brunch with cocktails & coffees not including service. It was a highlight of our trip, would definitely recommend!",29-Oct-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"I have visited the current restaurant quite a few time as I currently leave in Madrid. The food is really nice, the atmosphere, the service, everything for me compose a unique environment for having lunch or dinner. The greek suvlaki, the spanakopita, the lamp chops, everything is well done cooked and look alike the ones in Greece. It is worth having dinner",30-Sep-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Amazing Greek food!!! Such a lovely dinner, great wine, good service. Down a cute side street, outside seating, lovely inside too.  Would definitely recommend! Don't listen to the bad reviews this place is GREAT!",19-Sep-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,"This is arguably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  The meat was so tough we couldn't chew through 80% of it, the spanakotyropita were cold and dry and the chicken tasteless. For starters we shared a plate of ""Greek specialities"", and the only thing special about it was the price (high). To top it off they got our orders wrong twice, and just shrugged when we complained about the food.  This place needs to fire the entire staff",17-Sep-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"Chain of restaurants which got popular because the food used to be fresh and good. Now the food is average at best. I must have eaten here at least six times, and after the last time I won't go back",28-Aug-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Although I have tried many different restaurants in Madrid, and even quite a few Greek ones (both in Madrid and Greece), this place really stands out on my list. While we were originally planning to go somewhere else, but then left and stumbled upon this charming little restaurant by accident, we were not disappointed. The atmosphere is cozy yet chic, and the food was unbelievably delicious, from the salad and meat to the wonderful dessert. Everything here seems ordinary, yet very original at the same time, and makes for a really fun night out. The only downside to this place is the bored, uninterested staff, but then again, I can't remember when was the last time that a waiter in Madrid has been actually attentive...",2-Aug-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"The restaurant is very cozy and small. The service were good and the food delicious; the best to order Pikilia (to share) and Pasta Filo, simply great. Desserts are very tasty too, specially Greek Yogurt Ice-cream. Main dishes have large portions, which make them perfect to share so you can try different dishes. If you really want to eat Greek food in Madrid, this restaurant is a very good option. Furthermore, it is very near the city center, in a side street off the main square of Chueca & also close to the metro.",2-Aug-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"After having a great time outside with colleagues, my friend and I were hungry and while searching for something to eat, we stumbled upon this little gem. It looked fresh and quite noticeable, so we decided to try it. As it was Friday evening, it was almost full, but there was one table free. They prepared it for us and took our orders very quickly.  We did not have to wait long for the food to arrive despite the place being full of customers. We ordered moussaka, dolma and Greek-style chicken - all of them were very delicious. The waiters even treated us with Greek wine for free as I had made a comment that I had never tried Greek wine before (it was true). Overall, you could see the people enjoying themselves at Dionysos and our experience there was also very positive. Recommended.",8-Jul-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"we went to Dionisos for new year eve dinner : I know quie strange to go to a greek restaurant in Madrid for such a night but we went to the Original Dionisos in Barcelona in the summer and we had a very good meal . The same in Madrid !  it was a set menu and the restaurant was full and we started with Cava and some appetizer, followed by 3 course meal. Our waiter very friendly and smiley and made us feel very welcome .  it would not be a good Greek restaurant without breaking some plates at the end of evening !",4-Jan-12
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"This must be one of Madri's best deals. A set menu with great traditional dishes, splendid yoghurt and beverage for 10 euros can't be missed. Staff is kind and fairly efficient (specially compared to other places). Try it.",22-Sep-11

La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"I went in the evening for dinner in La Gaditana Castellana after reading the good reviews and i can definitely confirm the common opinion: VERY GOOD ! I was with a friend of mine and we asked for a table even without reservation ( on August 15 usually is not so easy to sit down immediately) : the very kind waiter ( Mr. Antonio) found immediately a table for us. We chose only PAELLA that was really good with seafood , octopus and a big red Prawn. We Drinked a beer and a mineral sparkling water. We got also ( for free and as a present by the Restaurant) some olives as starter. Even if we took a table not inside but in a glass patio outside, the noise was very low. The price we paid is perfect according to the food quality and the good and fast service . I suggest the Restaurant even if i cannot give different advices about the menu ( 90% is fish and seafood).",17-Aug-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"I went to Madrid for holiday, and i went twice in this restaurant, very good price and quality, i hope to come back soon Ciao",15-Aug-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,2,Negative,"I seriously do not understand why this place has good reviews. The food is not particularly good at all. Multiple dishes were average or worse. On the night we were there, the service was abysmal. They clearly needed 2 additional servers. Servers are not helpful in explaining the menu for non-English speakers, and the menu descriptions are vague. Good portion sizes, but most of our group of 9 did not enjoy their meal. Skip it.",14-Aug-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,Dinner was really good. We reviewed the menu and asked the waiter if he could create a 3 course dinner for us using seafood. He was more than accommodating and his selections were outstanding. Recommend!,27-Jul-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We read some excellent reviews and were not disappointed. The food was simply delicious with generous portion sizes making it good value considering where you are in Madrid. Staff were friendly, attentive (not overbearing) and it was clear all took pride in their work. Our waiter, Santi (I believe his name was), was thorough, thoughtful and humorous.  The fish dishes all looked fabulous. We tried the selection of fried seafood, which was huge as well as the truffled eggs - wow! We didnt need mains as those entrees were so big but we'd already ordered two of their special pork dishes. These were also sensational and cooked to perfection. Will return if ever back in Madrid.",6-Jul-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"shopping walking is a pleasure and if you are hungry around this area and like greek food - thats a place to go, eat great food, have nice friendly serve and a very reasonable priced menu with flexible order and glass of wine and coffee - just to recommend",13-Jan-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,Ordered the pork gyros. Not come across that before. But Spain is a country where pork rules. It was nothing like any other gyros have ever had but was absolutely delicious. Against my better judgement (already quite full) I had desert. The cake was a little dry but tasty. It looked empty and I almost kept walking for that reason but I was tired & decided I couldn't handle anywhere busy. Definitely rewarded.,11-Sep-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,Booked online a table with 30% discount.Good food.Quick service and friendly staff. Location busy. Parking can be a challenge.,3-Jul-18

Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"I love Greek food, and I loved this place! The food is very delicious, hard to choose just one dish, and the portions are pretty big. Very very good. You can‚Äôt go wrong with anything. They also bring you delicious warm bread.  The service is good and they bring you food pretty fast. We came here on Sunday for lunch around 13.30, we didn‚Äôt have reservation but still got the table. Although 20 mins later the place got packed and there were no free tables. So, if you‚Äôre planning in advance, it‚Äôs better to make the reservation, especially during the weekend. Amazing place, definitely coming back!",15-Apr-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"My wife and I had dinner at Dionisos, seated at one of the few tables just outside the restaurant, liked it so much that we returned the following night and the one after that! The service was speedy, efficient and friendly, and the food was amazing! We'd recently been to Greece and these meals were equal to any we'd had there! If you're in Madrid and are tired of the endless tapas, try some great Greek food offered in Calle Augusto Figueroa, just a short walk up from the Gran Via metro.",25-Sep-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,We came for a quick cold drink in the sun and stayed for some Greek starters - yum.  Free wifi and great service.  All round great experience.,16-Sep-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Went here to just get a drink and sat at an outside table but the menu of the day was tempting and good value, enjoyed the soup and bread and the chicken main. Would visit here again, it seemed very popular and the restaurant looked very nice and airy inside",13-Sep-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"We had dinner here last night and thought it was good. My daughter had an orzo based veal dish and my husband and I shared the barbeque for two. There was plenty of meat and we thought it was good. We did not order any appetizers as we had had a humongous lunch. Overall, good and if we come back to Madrid would go back.",17-Aug-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Although I have tried several Greek restaurants in Madrid (including another Dionisos location), to this day, this is the only place that I keep coming back to (and absolutely love doing so!). From the Greek-yet-cosmopolitan interior design to the lovely music and great atmosphere as well as the wonderful food, there is absolutely nothing negative to be said about this place. As if the Greek-y vibes and delicious dishes weren‚Äôt enough, the staff also makes sure to offer their best form of Greek hospitality and service, perhaps in a bid to upstage the neighboring venues staffed by Spaniards. Since customer service and dedicated waiters are practically non-existent in Madrid, it‚Äôs a great relief to come here and find people that actually seem to care about your experience. Furthermore, the prices are pretty reasonable and for the ‚Äúmenu del d√≠a‚Äù, practically a bargain. Though it now runs at 11 euros, it offers a great variety of Greek dishes and is the perfect opportunity to try new things as well as experiment. Despite being the ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù option (which is often done carelessly in other places), each dish is still nicely arranged and timely served, hence making it a fulfilling three-course lunch experience. The cherry on top is of course the dessert which is a small slice of cake/pastry topped with vanilla ice cream and cinnamon spice (though yogurt and other options are also available). Perfection? I think yes.",30-Jul-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"Great place to dine.  Nice staff, food was ok.  A great little chain that I've also been to in Barcelona.",19-May-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"This is not a proper greek restaurant, they serve mediterranean style food, but is far from great. Its just another restaurant chain, where food is fine, but nothing special. If you know about geek cuisine you'll be disappointed. I liked the restaurant staff, who were all very nice and attentive. The restaurant itself is not big and there is no much space among tables. Food is not pricey but I would expect to pay less for what you get.",17-Apr-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Many time we have walked around this place but never get inside. This time we decided to try it and the experience was really nice! (It has been our first time in a greek restaurant in Madrid). The restaurant is pleasant and clean. The dishes were nice looking and enough in quantity and quality. We enjoy green salad, kritharaki with sea food (the Greek version of risotto with a variety of pasta instead rice) and gemista a traditional Greek food with stuffed vegetables with rice and herbs. The price was very good for the city, the atmosphere friendly and as a resume I have to say that it's a nice place to come back and try more greek receipts with my friends.",12-Dec-14
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"The decorations is great! Forget the kitsch, status etc, pure Greek cozy style. The food: Well being Greek, I practically never go to Greek restaurants abroad. Dionisos is the only exception! Very good quality of food in reasonable prices. Very good service! The owner is really nice and together with his team takes care of everything! Excellent menu for any taste. Their mousaka was voted as the best mousaka in Spain! Cheap menu during lunch time. Do NOT miss (during summer time) home made Greek frozen yogurt with Greek sweets on the top. You will never forget its taste! ",29-Oct-14
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"I've been to Dionisos three times already being a fan of Greek Cuisine. First time was great, found everything perfect and happy I finally found an original Greek in Madrid, the other two experiences were bad. The second time I went, I found terrible service and the food was nothing special. Gave it a third go, couldn't resist to eat a good Mussaka, but again, nothing special. After my first great visit I expected much more, I am surely disappointed now, probably won't go again. My opinion is based on average food quality and the terrible experience I had with a male waiter!",6-Oct-14
Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,5,Positive,"Great music and a lovely place, a bit hidden as it‚Äôs on e rooftopbar on a gym. But I would really recommend it üï∫üèº. Thanks Joseph for te goo service",3-Oct-18

Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,"I visited with a group of friends on the weekend, the restaurant looked lovely but the service and food was the worst I'd encountered in a long time! The staff were very abrupt and and acted as if us being there was an utter inconvenience! We tried to order some drinks and they wouldn't let us until we'd ordered the food. They would just walk away when we were asking questions about the menu, I should point out we were one of two tables and we all spoke fluent Spanish. The food was terrible. For instance I ordered falafels and they had no salt or any spices in them, just chewy chickpeas in a ball! The mustard chicken was also flavourless and the colour of Big Bird! When we ordered our coffee they got mine wrong, he didn't even apologise and ask if I wanted another one. He just left it there expecting me to drink it and I had to ask him to take it away so I didn't get charged. At the end of the evening about being rude to our table we paid the bill, he didn't even bother to bring us our change which was over ‚Ç¨10!  The visit was a complete waste of time and money, there are much nicer places to eat in Madrid where you will actually be treated like a human being!",3-Jul-15
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,"The food is mediocre at best (We ordered the 15‚Ç¨ evening menu). Everything was very bland and it looked like my chicken had been unfrozen after having been stored in the freezer for months. Majority of the staff was incredibly rude and inept. On the plus side: the Greek yoghurt was nice. However, it doesn't make up for everything else.",1-Jul-15
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Very great place, amazing food, and very attentive and helpful waiter, by far the best restaurant we‚Äôve been to in Madrid!",5-Jul-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Made an account just to pay my regards to this place. Best meal I had in Madrid during our stay. Go for the 7 course meal, which might only be on the Spanish menu. Our server, Driss, was very kind and spoke English well, and helped translate the menu for us. He was willing to take the time with us tourists to make sure we enjoyed our meal. This is a must return place for me next time I come to Madrid.",4-Jul-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We had dinner at La Gaditana Castellana on our last night in Madrid. The food was excellent and service was even better.  The place is really nice, nestled below ground but it didn't feel nor did look claustrophobic, on the contrary, you wouldn't know you were underground if it wasn't for the upper windows and the people that walked by. Our waiter, Jose Manuel, was truly amazing, he made sure our food was prepared the way we requested and served in a timely manner. His suggestions were greatly appreciated and we thanked him for it.",3-Jul-19
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"I came here with high expectations but the reality was different. It is a very nice place to eat; comfortable, cosy and welcoming. However the food didn't pay at all. Don't misunderstandme, it was good but to be far it could have been served in any other restaurant although we order some of the greek specialities in the menu they were plain food (carefully served, though). Summing up, nice place, service and atmosphere but average food!",8-Dec-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"This place was packed when we left, very popular.  It's the local twist on traditional Greek food, well-prepared.  Excellent service and reasonable prices.",1-Dec-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,This is an excellent Greek restaurant. The food is lovely and very well presented. There is plenty of choice. The staff are very efficient,27-Sep-17
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"It was a very inviting restaurant and filled up quickly so make a reservation.  They did a few good deals but we weren't hungry enough for three courses. Unfortunately we were sat by the window which was a but drafty. There was an English page on the menu which was helpful as a few dishes were hard to translate. We each chose something different, but I found (although very typical Greek) it was a large pile of (very succulent) meat with two quarters of a potato and a smear of taziki. It needed a bit more to accompany. Also when buying sides I recommend mentioning if its for one or for the group. The waiters were friendly and accommodating. It was a little on the pricey side but I am glad we went.",7-Feb-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,We were looking for a place late at night to grab a bite to eat and stumbled by this place. The food was really good and the prices were very reasonable! The lentil soup was really good!,11-Jan-16
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,I usually don't try greek food in greek restaurants in europe but my first experience was really amazing.The food was familiar to really greek food and everything was very good.Quallity in food service and atmosphere made me change my opinion about greek restaurants around europe.If you travel to madrid don't miss it .. especially eksoxiko was excellent.,29-Mar-13

Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Our family was starved and searching for a lunch spot when we wandered up to this eatery. We were reading the posted menu, hemming and hawing, when a customer stuck her head out of the door and told us, first in Spanish, and then, kindly, in English, to come in because the food is really good. She was right. We all loved our dishes -- we mostly stuck to classics, Greek salad, stuffed grape leaves, calamari, etc. and were not disappointed. The atmoshpere was friendly and casual. Waiters made a nice effort to communicate, despite our poor Spanish.",4-Mar-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"Nice style, busy place friendly if slightly over-confident service. The maze starter was ok for two. Plenty of choice all tasted ok. Served with pitta bread which was strangely an extra on the bill Main courses of monk fish with mussel sauce, quite nice but very salty, and a chicken pastry which the waiter insisted was amazing and was ok. Lovely Greek yoghurt ice cream afterwards was very refreshing and tasty. A nice place with friendly service and just a sense the food could be more refined.",12-Jan-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"Really great menu of the day for 10.00‚Ç¨ plus local taxes is offered at lunchtimes and so on this occasion we visited this well lit delightfully clean restaurant of the Main Street in Madrid . The menu of the day was great value offering a wide variety of Greek Starters, Mains & Desserts that were of good choice, we opted for Taromasalata, Houmous, and Greek Salad and after two ordered the Gyros Pork dish and I ordered the Pasticio a Greek pasta dish. The food was of good flavor and very tasty but from here the waiter made you feel unwelcome after the order was taken throwing almost dishes on the table with no smile or communication it made you feel that you should not be there and marred the lunch in our eyes. This waiter continued to hover around our table and within 10 seconds of cutlery being placed on the plates was clearing the dishes and offering coffees & desserts and after speaking to him in Spanish that we wanted a rest he seemed put out. Declining anything else it then took 10 minutes to get the bill and then the head was thrown back when no tip was left . I have lived in Spain 11 years and Spanish never leave any kind of tip but even if I do what the locals do I always leave a couple of coins but on this occasion felt that this guy was lucky to have a job in this crisis/recession and should take a look in the mirror on how he deals with future customers because they'll be a lot more happier people to fill his boots.",29-Dec-12
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"I've never been to Greece, but I live down the street from this restaurant. I went once, totally want to go again. If you don't know anything about Greek food, like me, then you can always share a starter platter.  It's got lots of nibblies like taziki, hummus, felafel, salads, sauces and bread. Lovely presentation and its all just so flavorful.  If you like wine, you wont like the white wine in the window, don't order it, its just for decoration.",5-Dec-12
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"Food and service were fine, but the waiter had difficulty processing my Visa card, which is issued on a US bank and so uses swipe-and-sign. The manager was successful. However, after leaving the restaurant I saw that he processed the charges in dollars rather than in euros. The receipt stated that ""I accept that I have been offered a choices of currencies."" I was not. The exchange rate was 3% mark-up over wholesale rate provided by Visa. This made for a very unhappy memory.",29-Nov-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Great place.. great experience... great food. 1000% recommended if you want to have a great food with your family or couple,11-May-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,2,Negative,"The quality of the food is low, does not taste anywhere near how real Greek food should taste. Perhaps it is the ingredients, perhaps it is the execution, hard to tell. But I would be very surprised if the chef was Greek. Even the desserts, that are difficult to get wrong, did not taste very good. It is worth noting that there were 3 Greek people in our group who were not impressed. Service was OK even though it could be more polished and polite. You'd do better trying another of the Greek restaurants in Madrid.",27-Sep-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We had a lovely meal in this gem of a restaurant. It feels like eating at your favorite aunt‚Äôs house- very relaxed, with food that is delicious and an interesting change from typical Madrid restaurants and bars. The sisters who run it make a great team and we got to thank the one who is the chef at the end of the evening. Highly recommend coming here.",12-Jul-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"Highly recommend this greek restaurant in Chueca. Standard greek food done to a high degree with a great ambience and warm, attentive service. The grilled octopus was a stand out along with their appetizer platter with soft, homemade pita. Always crowded - reservations highly recommended on weekend evenings. One of the most delicious meals I had during my stay in Madrid.",24-Oct-12
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,I always make time to visit this restaurant when in Madrid. It has all the ambience and flavour of Greece in the middle of Spain. food quality and service is well worth the visit and costs are reasonable You really need to book thoufg because it is usually very busy Highly reccommended,29-Aug-12
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,"The only good thing about this restaurant was the cool design but apart from that we had an appalling service: waited about 10 minutes to grab the attention of the waitress to take our order (and there were only other tables with clients!), when we ased what the caf√© Dionisos was she just pointed to the other table as if we could tell which ingredients were included in the drink, then they didn¬¥t have the type of pita bread for our dish so they were replacing it by a smaller one but putting it separately since it couldn¬¥t be a pita bread sandwich (a bit worrying in a Greek restaurant!), instead of taking our plate and asking us if we wanted anything else, well the waitress decided to mob the floor (nice when you have clients waiting to grab attention) and finally there was another employee who was shouting on her mobile just behind our table. Well this would have been kind of ok because it is difficult to get a good service in most of the restaurants in Madrid but the worse was the food. My friend ordered a roasted chicken that looked like boiled fat chicken and that represented half of the chicken on her plate, the rest looked like bad quality chicken plus burnt mushy fries....all in all the only happy one was my dog who ate it all!",13-Jun-12
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Definitely need a reservation and may be difficult to get a table in the busy season but absolutely worth it! From start to finish the evening was delightful. The food was exceptional and well priced for the quality. I would recommend the oxtail and the rabbit pasta. The atmosphere was very friendly and the two sisters who run the restaurant are very welcoming. This restaurant is a must if visiting Madrid. ,11-May-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is a very special restaurant. It serves authentic, honest and extremely well executed cuisine from the Rioja region of Spain. The experience starts with a very warm welcome by Isabel and Pilar, two sisters who own and manage the restaurant gracefully and with a unique charm. All the food is hand selected and prepared on site to utmost standards. Rioja cuisine is known for its freshness and the high quality of its produce. Typical dishes include Chicken Pepitoria, Ox Tail and Cod Fish Rioja Style; all guaranteed to leave a pleasant memory in your mind. Our family has been visiting Algarabia on a yearly basis, for 4 consecutive years. It has now become a tradition for all our trips to Madrid. I should also add that the place is very romantic and the service very attentive catering to every visitor‚Äôs peculiar tastes. There is a vast wine selection, but I must say that the restaurant's own Rioja Wine vintage is wonderful and outstanding.",29-Apr-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The food and service at Algarabia are excellent. Make reservations in advance because it is a small and very cosy restaurant. The food presented is from Rioja where Isabel (the hostess) and Pilar (the chef) are from.  They both make you feel at home.  We had dinner here in October 2017 and came back again in April 2018. This time had the tasting menu (‚Ç¨38) and it was excellent. The house red wines, also from Rioja, are an excellent option. And as Isabel likes to say: ""Una comida sin vino, es desayuno"".  Isabel and Pilar, thanks for a lovely evening with delicious food. We will return next time are in Madrid. ",29-Apr-18

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"You definitely need a reservation, as there are only a few tables. The dining room is really cozy, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The food was wonderful! We loved every bite. The shrimp croquettes were perfect: flavorful but not fishy. The rabbit pasta was so good...just the right amount of salt. My husband enjoyed his pork immensely, but the star of the meal was the oxtail. It was so tender and rich! We did not have room for dessert, but we enjoyed every minute of our long meal. This is the kind of place to go if you like good food and conversation with your dining partners. Don‚Äôt expect a quick dinner. It‚Äôs meant to be enjoyed at a leisurely pace. At the end of the night, we spoke with the chef (the sister of the hostess), and she is fun to chat with. Make a reservation. You won‚Äôt regret it.",27-Mar-18

Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"A pleasant evening - average service by our standards, good by Spanish standards. Mixed starter was tasty but the salmon dip was strangely pink.... Mains were good but not the same as what we have in Greece. Not expensive and made a nice change from all the tapas! Would be prepared to make a 2nd visit to try other dishes from the menu. Looks like it does a keen takeaway service.",28-Jun-14
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"We came across this place on a Sunday night when a lot of the other restaurants seemed to be closed. Glad we did as although we hadn't anticipated a Greek meal that night, it was delicious. Would thoroughly recommend the monk fish and the oxtail for main. The only downside was the staff didn't speak English at all (although the menu was in English) and they gave my friend the wrong drink. I think because she asked for a Sangira, which wasn't on the menu so they just brought her a beer instead!! Think the staff were having a bit of a joke about the language barrier which was a little uncomfortable, but the food still made up for it.",19-Jun-14

The hilopetes had nice drops of pesto around the plate, as wellas the nice chocolate decoration on the tarta de chocolate! 8/10 Food: VERY FRESH AND GOOD/TASTY COOKED!! the quantity is for the price very ok, and it is so well and fine cooked, you will feel good all the day! the Hilopetes had a good quality atuna fish and the chuleta was fantastic tender cooked with a very nice, fine wine sauce. the potates around made the meat even more delicious! The greek dessert are usually extremely sweet. The chocolate tarte is a good choice for a medium sweetness! 9/10 Advise: I don t get payed from trip advisor, but I really love to get fine food for a good price around europe/world! The lunch menu is always fantastic here, in this restaurant, even if they also make some mistakes( once they forgot some bread, charching that on the bill: the food was sometimes not top cooked). The place is very small like in paris bistro, the food is very mediterranean. you can find gyros as well as other mediterranean food! I also can advise you Moussaka there, hilopetes and other strters. Try chocolate tarte and figs tarte with icecream! try first the lunch menu! On the weekend is very busy, I would avoid it!  Final Score: 9/10",25-Apr-14
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,We went last night for my sons Birthday and the mixed starter was lovely and then 2 out of 3 of us chose to have the Moussaka for our main. It came and disappointing is an understatement. The bottom of it was so badly burned you could not eat any of it. When the waiter came to take our plates away and it was obvious we had hardly touched the meal he didn't even ask why. He took them away with no comment at all. Minutes later the waitress came over and asked what was wrong but just shrugged her shoulders when we told her. The waitress had seen the remains of the burnt offering in the kitchen. So no apology and they insisted we pay the full price of the meal.  So fair to say we will never be back at this Dionisos in Calle San Gregorio Madrid. We were truly disappointed.,1-Apr-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"What a little gem. A cozy little place. Some of us needed to learn to use our indoor voice, but we had a great time. The food was wonderful, but only a part of the experience for us. The 2 sisters that own and run the restaurant are so charming and nice, so it makes the food almost secondary, but as I said the food is wonderful. If we get back to Madrid we will make sure to get back to Algarabia.",2-Jul-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We just had a splendid dinner with friends at Algarab√≠a (as we did also last night) and can only rave about the excellence of the food and the warmth and comfort of the restaurant. We had not been to Madrid for several years and were thrilled to find that not only was the restaurant still there but the food had not lost any of its quality and originality. A haven for Rioja food in Madrid, everything from the appetizers (including the glorious crackling asparagus and the superb croquetas) to the desert (baked apples with toffee foam) was to-die-for. Try the chumarro with onion confit (a dream) or the bacalao a la riojana. Amazing dishes and impressive charm.Their house wine is a delicate and tasty rioja. Can't wait to go back.",14-Jun-18

Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"Yesterday night I went there with my girlfriend and her parents. Truth be told I'd never eaten Greek food before, the only thing I knew about Greece were the financial crisis and the parthenon. But I felt really pleased since I got there, a really quiet and calmed place, no children around, food was absolutely excellent and I think what I liked the most was the service, they advice us about every dish we were about to order and recommended some of them, dessert included. At the end they gifted us some sort of ""Christmas greek cakes which I didn't like so much"" But apart from that everything was great. I truly recommend the experience.",4-Jan-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"We booked this prior to the date, as we had a large number in our party. The lady who served us, was the sister of the chef and it was lovely to be introduced to the chef at the end of the meal.. the restaurant was like sitting in someone's house, very quaint. The meals were very homely and delicious and very large servings - almost too much. The wine was very good.  A good place to eat and I got a thank you email the following day",6-Oct-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Visited this restaurant after finding on trip advisor. Inside the restaurant the layout and design is quirky yet traditional. The staff were extremely attentive and friendly, explaining the ingredients of the dishes presented on the menu and went out of their way to make you feel welcome. We both chose the Veal Cheek Cannelloni and it was amazing. Fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. A little bit more pricy than other restaurants in Madrid but well worth it! We were lucky to find this restaurant and would highly recommend! ",12-Apr-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Due to an Iberia flight cancellation we found ourselves stuck in Barajas for the evening, tired and hungry. We called Algarabia and Isabel let us us know with a hearty laugh she could have a bottle of icy cold Cava waiting for us at 2000.. and off to Rioja we went! Arriving at Alagarabia is always like coming home, greeted by Isabe'sl warm hugs and kisses and the wonderful aromas of Pilar in the kitchen.  There are many new dishes on the menu so we opted for a mix of the new and some of our old favorites. Pilar's signature croquettes and crispy asparagus are always a must for starters, but the pasta with rabbit bolognese is now on our list as well. Pilar suggested we also try the sautee of borage, mushrooms and shrimp before moving onto mains and the house Rioja, so add one more to our list.. just keep the Cava coming! For mains we opted for an old favorite, Pilar's classic ox tail in red wine sauce, in my opinion Madrid's finest rendition of this classic dish. For the new, bacalao a la Riojana was intensely satisfying, the delicate cod just caressed by the rich sauce. Both dishes paired beautifully with the David Moreno house Rioja. Dessert of pears in red wine sauce and herb aguardiente topped off a wonderful evening in Rioja with Isabel and Pilar.. Gracias chicas!!",24-Mar-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I planned a birthday dinner for one of my two daughters and I was looking for something different and local. I stumbled into multiple great reviews on this site for Algarabia Restaurant and thought that it would be the perfect mix as it is owned by two sisters as I was bringing my two daughters and wife. Not only were the bechamel croquetas the perfect blend of creamy crunchiness, and their version of rabo encendido, perfectly slowed cooked - the meat barely hanging to the bone, dressed with a strong but not overpowering reduction, the bacalao flaky and fresh, the pear dessert, an unassuming simple but just the right sweetness to finish the dinner with a bang. All these things would make the experience memorable in any other restaurant. But when you add the personality of the two sisters, one that entertains and manage the floor and the other one that cooks, then this becomes a very special experience. In a city where eating is a religion, eating at Algarabia will not dissapoint. You cannot afford not going next time you are in town.",23-Mar-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Intimate dinner, felt like being in the dining room of good friends. Great food, great hostess, Isabel, and her sister, chef, Pilar. Had house pate to start, then lamb with beans salad, and Algarabia croquettes for appetizers. Delicious! House wine (Rioja) was great. Mains were oxtail stew, and baby squid stew. Outstanding! It was a flawless dinner, including great conversation with the sisters. A special dining experience that I won't forget. Go there, you won't be disappointed.",12-Mar-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My wife and I brought our daughter and husband to Spain - all our first trip to Spain - and I wanted the first dinner there to be something special. I did my research on TA and decided on Algarabia, near the opera on a side street and a short walk from our hotel. It is a small restaurant, maybe 6 - 8 tables, a very homey atmosphere (looks like that is what it was - a house - and we were in the living room!). We got a large table in a corner. I made our reservation online a few weeks in advance and got one for their opening time. Even so, two other tables were filled and all were filled within the hour, so reservations are highly recommended. We had several appetizers, including quail legs (see picture), which were quite interesting. All entrees were delicious (cod, pasta, very lean beef). Excellent wine. We had a great time and got the obligatory picture with Pilar, sorry I didn't get one with Isabel (the two sisters-owners). We only spent two days in Madrid, you need 4-5 days here, so we will be back and look forward to dinner again at Algarabia!!",16-Feb-18
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,"We always seem to be able to find a Greek restaurant wherever we visit!!! We found this lovely place in Madrid.

Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"I absolutely enjoyed my meal, the food was authentic and very tasty. The waitress that served us was had a really good attitude.

We will definitely return to Algarabia when we return to Madrid. ",17-May-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Went there with my family. We were a party of 8. The food was very good. And the place it self was very very nice. Highly recommended,16-May-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"I went there based on TripAdvisor ratings but felt I was in a different place to what was described. There certainly are quite a lot of choices on the menu, and maybe I chose poorly. The service was very good and efficient and the couple of nibbles of things given early were really the best part. I had the quail breasts which were several parcels of breast covered in a very gluggy brown sauce. The taste wasn‚Äôt unpleasant, but wasn‚Äôt nice either. This was followed you calamari in an inky and watery sauce served with white (now grey) rice noodles. Again, very bland. The house wine from Rioja was very nice. Maybe it was an off night.",12-May-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I decided to try this restaurant because of other reviews.  Around this area are lots of touristy looking restaurants. Walking up the narrow street I was unsure about my decision - the restaurant looked closed. I rang the bell - thinking that I was wasting my time, butt when the door was opened and I was invited in, I felt like I had been invited into a home. I was the only guest of the restaurant when I arrived, but I did not feel uncomfortable more a special guest.  I was given a small dish of pate whilst I read the menu. It was delicious.  I then ordered a fried asparagus and a braised pork and caramelized onion. Both were the highlights of my trip to Madrid.  Normally I would stop there, but was convinced to try the black chocolate tart. It was also delicious, as was the wine. I got to talking with both the ladies of this restaurant. It was just like being with family. I had eaten in a lot of restaurants in the past week as a solo diner but this was the first restaurant that made me feel welcome rather than a person who should be put in the corner or pitied. I had a wonderful time. I would certainly visit again and will suggest it to friends who are in Madrid. Thank you Ladies!",27-Jul-13

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We arrived at this place before opening and the hostess, no doubt seeing our hungry faces, opening early just for us! The restaurant is a island of quiet authenticity in a sea of touristy paella restaurants. Everything from the food to the wine was excellent. But what really set Algarabia apart was the service. A gracious welcome, constant attention, and a healthy dose of warmth and humour made for a fantastic dining experience. If I'm ever back in Madrid, Algarabia is the first restaurant I'd return to.",13-Jul-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We stumbled upon this place at 11:30 in the evening on a Tuesday night after being turned away from a couple restaurants closer to Plaza Mayor because it was too late (in Spain?!) Algarab√≠a (meaning gibberish, from Arabic al-Arabiya literally meaning ""Arabic"") was one of the last recommendations for the area in our Lonely Planet guidebook and we almost didn't go because it was just one dollar sign, and usually we choose two dollar sign places hoping that price equates to quality. Rookie mistake!  We walked in just as the only other table was chatting with the chef and leaving. We thought perhaps this restaurant too would turn us away but an ""este bien"" got us seated. The host/waitress was a sweet middle aged woman who explained that she and her sister, the chef, owned the place and they served Rioja food which was famous for its wines, not its food, though it should be. And it should be! Everything was very reasonably priced. The wine was wonderful. We were brought a complimentary p√¢t√© (""the speciality of the house,"" she said, ""my sister made this,"") which is one of the best I've ever had. We had the escargot (Rioja style--many small snails in tomato broth) and the oxtail which was as tender as prime rib and more tasty. At the end of the meal we had a dark chocolate and raspberry tart which was incredible and a nice chat with the two sisters in the empty restaurant.  This was definitely one of the best meals I've ever had and if I ate it in a nice restaurant in my home state of Oklahoma it would have cost double. I'm sure my wife and I will always remember our honeymoon in Madrid fondly because of nights and food and people like this.  One note: they said if you're coming in at 11:30 p.m. it's a good idea to call ahead and let them know you're coming.",10-Jul-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"This restaurant whilst a little expensive presents very good food. The experience of a varied and interesting menu is enhanced by the two sisters who run it, the chef and the host. Good wine from obviously a friends vineyard and lots of Bon homie. Recommend it for the usual late night dinner in Madrid. They dont open until 9.30 so go and have some drinks and tapas early on before the experiential eating.",4-Jul-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,1,Negative,Went today and paid 46 euros for a tiny entree (supposedly for 2) 2 glasses of ok wine and an small plate of moussaka.Service from the moment we walked in was unfriendly and we really should have left straight away. I told the manager when we left that for the money there was very little food and she shrugged her shoulders and could not have been less interested. Definitely could have found find a better option!,21-Dec-13

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"A small familiar restaurant, where everything is made by two sisters: Isabel at the saloon and Pillar, the chef. Notwithstanding, in this house at the heart of Madrid they make you feel like in a movie by Pedro Almod√≥var, plenty of colors, smells and tastes, with flowers and familiar furniture. Furthermore, Isabel attends with attention and enormous sympathy, and the food made by Pillar is an outstanding version of spanish traditional home dishes. Small but very good wine suggestions, and a Pedro Ximenez for the road made our dinner an experience to remember. Traditional, familiar and very competent. A place that deserves a visit if you`re in Madrid",1-Oct-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We ate dinner here our first night in Spain. It was a great way to kick off the trip.

Very quaint and quiet but a perfect place for good food. Very friendly and accommodating to English speaking guest.",23-Sep-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Went here after seeing the reviews on TA. It was pretty hard to find as it's in a small alley and GPS doesn't really work. The first time we went, they were full (only 5-6 tables) so we made a reservation for the following night.  The restaurant is run by 2 sisters and it feels like you're eating in their home! The menu is traditional Spanish and not very extensive. All of the dishes we had were extremely flavorful - definitely try the Oxtail and chickpea soup and Chorizo! Service was excellent and the meal was one of the highlights of our trip!",12-Sep-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"You know when you go for dinner at your best friends house and you just know that you will feel welcome and relaxed, you will like the food and you will come away smiling well that is the best way I can describe this gem in Madrid. I won't describe the food as I couldn't do it justice but I enjoyed every mouthful. I am almost a little bit reluctant to spread the word about this place in case I can't get in when I want to! Enjoy",11-Sep-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,You will find great food and a warm welcome. The menu is traditional Spanish with the chefs own adaptations turn up at 9 pm or phone to book it gets busy very early . This is a small venue that deserves your support .We ate there twice and each time the food was lovely.,7-Sep-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This dinner was definitely one of the best restaurants on our trip to Madrid and highly recommended. The food exceptionally good in an intimate setting. It was reasonably priced. The wait staff was attentive, not intrusive, and welcoming. We had fresh baby artichokes newly in season and a light but flavorful tomato soup garnished with menchengo cheese for our appetizers. For our main course we had canneloni stuffed with very tender veal cheeks in a light, homemade pasta sauce, tender moist monkfish that was lightly seared. It was evident that the chef took pride as he described the selections on the menu.",6-Apr-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This is a wonderful restaurant. Small and quaint, with a personal touch and fantastic friendly service. I had one of the best meals in Madrid.

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Amazing food, paired with wonderful service and humour also thrown into the equation. The restaurant is run by two sisters, they serve food that you will lick off the spoon at the end of the meal. The sisters give each customer personal attention and explain how they cook their foods. We highly recommend the wrapped asparagus and the oxtail. The asparagus is crispy and incredibly flavourful and the oxtail practically melts in your mouth, superbly delicious! Do not miss it :)",1-Jul-13

Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"This was our first dinner in Spain. This is a small restaurant operated by two sisters, Isabel runs the front end and her sister, Pilar, is the chef. We were the only guest on a mid-week. The day before had a national holiday so it was quiet evening. We had a very good meal and since we were the only guests, felt we were guests in a private home. The food was very good and the experience warm and memorable.",28-May-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Four of us had a terrific evening at Algarabia. We had a good Spanish-speaker with us but we all felt the warmth of the attention we received. The Rioja they have specially bottled was excellent and two bottles slipped down easily. Asparagus, beans and loin of pork were all brilliant. At the end one of the sisters put on her wellington boots to go up the tiny street in heavy eain and fetch us a taxi. Best night of the five we had in Madrid. ",5-May-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,5,Positive,We had a nice family lunch with one child and one toddler. The food was excellent and very good value for money. The service very good and the staff extremely nice and helpful. The place is small and almost a must to reserve in advance.,7-Apr-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,4,Positive,"We really enjoyed ourselves in this restaurant. We had four dishes, and three of them were very good; one was disappointing, in that it tasted reheated, but the other three were fresh and high-quality. The service was outstanding and they really made us feel at home. Restaurants in Madrid are generally pretty expensive; this place is a nice exception to that rule in that their prices provide good value. If we weren't leaving Madrid tomorrow, we'd definitely go back. A useful tip: our waitress did not let us know until half way through dinner that she spoke English; I think she was waiting to see how we treated her before speaking English - she was charming in Spanish and English.",1-Apr-13
Dionisos_Figueroa,3,Negative,"Nothing too special. Not in food, not in drinks, not in service. Typical place fr a quick dinner before going out in Chueca.",1-Apr-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I decided to try this restaurant because of TA reviews. The food was great and the experience was unforgettable. This restaurant is a great find, the service and the atmosphere make it a unique place. The restaurant is run by two sisters. Small menu. Food was 100% delicious. you won't be disappointed!",4-Sep-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"We took our daughter and her room mate to dinner at Algarabia. It is a quaint, lovely, restaurant, run by two sisters (one hostess, one chef). The setting and service were wonderful. The meal was exquisite - Pork Tenderloin, Pasta, chocolate torte! Would definitely go again!",1-Sep-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We were not very sure of the location of the restaurant, even though we had the address. Walking up the narrow street, we asked a policeman. He showed us the door. At first, we thought it was closed. After we rang the doorbell, a lady opened the door and invited us in. She was very friendly and service was excellent. We enjoyed the meal. Great ambience. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",28-Aug-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We hadn't intended to go to this restaurant, but we're really glad we did - it was our anniversary and the restaurant we'd booked two weeks in advance (Homemade) inexplicably cancelled our booking at the last minute. Fortunately, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise - Algarabia was everything we could have wanted and more.  If I hadn't read about Algarabia on Trip Advisor, I could easily have walked straight past it - from the outside it looked closed - the door was shut and there was no 'open/closed' sign. Nevertheless, once inside, we received a warm welcome from the hostess - she speaks very little English, but it's clear that Algarabia isn't set up primarily to cater for tourists and that suited us fine - we loved the authentic bohemian atmosphere.  As for the food itself, it was the best meal we'd had all holiday. The menu was creative and unusual - particularly memorable were the squared lambs feet - utterly different from anything either my partner or I had ever tasted before. A fantastic finishing touch was that after the meal, the chef took the time to individually talk to all the diners in the restaurant. For an charming family run Spanish restaurant with an authentic feel, you won't find better than Algarabia.",23-Aug-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The bookcases and paintings imbue this small restaurant with the intimacy of a living room. The very friendly, thoughtful, and attentive service reinforces the impression of being honoured and long-awaited guests rather than paying customers. We had dinner with friends here and, more recently, a lunch with the two of us. In both cases we were completely happy. The menu is short, but all the dishes we sampled here were delicious. When we had made our choices, the owner suggested he serve us two half-size portions of the starters rather than complete ones, worrying that otherwise we would order more than we could eat. These starters (leeks! and artichoke hearts) are subtle, original vegetarian dishes. The pulpo and mackerel were no less tasty. The sweets were worthy conclusions. Since this is a vinoteca, the restaurant has many open wines, and generously offers its guests a sip of two to decide which they like best. We were particularly impressed by a local white wine called Caesar (?). Lunching or dining at Moratin is a wonderful experience thanks to the quality of the food and wine no less than thanks to the hospitable atmosphere. Make sure to make a reservation (by phone or in person) well in advance.",31-Dec-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Just book it; you won't regret it as Moratin gets everything right. It's so good that I went twice in four nights. Cozy, comfortable atmosphere just like home. Entire menu explained by Marcos, the chef/owner. Well trained, polite wait staff. Superb cuisine: best octopus I've ever had plus veal cheeks are outstanding. Great wine by the glass list. Wonderful ricotta cheesecake. All in all a memorable evening.",22-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"As regular Madrid visitors we are always trying new places and on the basis of what I had read and a recommendation from a local expert we booked Moratin Vinoteca for lunch. You get the feeling from the minute that you enter that this is going to be a very enjoyable experience and it was. The warm welcome, the lovely setting and the detailed explanation of the dishes by Marcos the owner and chef made us feel very at home. We shared two dishes that were available in half portions, tomato soup like I have never tasted bursting with flavour, a marinated salmon dish, not my favourite fish but so very good. This was followed my two main dishes, the pulpo and the ox cheek cannelloni both excellent. The bill with two glasses of wine each was incredible value for cooking of that quality. We cannot wait to return in January.",15-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We had an ""early"" reservation by Spanish standards and were among the first guests at the restaurant on a Thursday night. We were warmly greeted by Marcos, the chef/owner. We shared stories of New York and he recommended some amazing local wines for us to try. The food is incredibly fresh and well prepared. Marcos recommended the artichokes, which were in peak season, and I have never had such tender and flavorful artichokes! I still dream about them. The entire meal progressed like this, excellent wines paired by marcos with his incredible cooking.  We had to cut our meal slightly short to catch a show, but we enjoyed it so much we came back 2 nights later (and we were only in Madrid for 3 nights!).  If you are in Madrid, you must visit. And go soon before he gets a Michelin star and raises the prices :)",12-Jun-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Very friendly welcome, even though I do not know to talk spanish very well. Very charming and attentive service - the cuisine is very creative, fresh and without doubt excellent! Perfect wine pairing - my favorite restaurant at Madrid!",2-Oct-14

La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We ordered too much but it was sooooo good. The wait staff didn't speak much English, but we all muddled through. High quality, tasty, and not crazy priced. Right across the street from The Intercontinental hotel. Highly recommend.",13-Oct-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"My wife and I had dinner at this restaurant on the last night of our two week trip to Spain. This was a perfect way to top off our vacation. The inside of the restaurant is quite pretty, with interesting art work. The service is outstanding. One of the owners took a lot of time to explain the menu to us and to describe in detail the various dishes. They were all delicious. We also had a wonderful bottle of wine.",28-May-18

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,We visited Marcos at the Moratin. The service was excellent. Marcos spent a lot of time with us running through the menu and made recommendations. We all had the home made soup and mackerel which were both excellent and would highly recommended. Wine menu was good and again Marco made a good recommendation. I would highly suggest a visit to Moratin Vinoteca ,14-May-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,I was hesitant to write a review as I wanted to keep this place a secret a little longer as it is becoming difficult to get a table. Fantastic service from very knowledgeable owners and the food is great quality. Wine selection is also top notch for fantastic national wines that they can help you choose. My favorite dishes are the salmon and one of the best steak tartars I have tried in Madrid with a spicy touch of ah√≠. Desserts are also very well prepared. The value is excellent for the quality and I will return soon but will have to reserve a table ahead of time.,27-Jul-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Reservations are pretty much required to get a seat in this small and very popular dining spot. Service was good and attentive. The cuisine was regional and very well presented. We had artichokes, leeks with romesco sauce, grilled hake, octopus (pulpo) and the steak tartar. The steak tartar was very flavorful and well prepared. It's deservedly the star of the menu.",26-Jun-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Based on classic Spanish but with that twist that lifts it above most other restaurants I tried in Madrid. Perfect service from waiters that make you feel welcome and who will guide you through the menu and wine list in a comfortable way - no push for expensive wines or anything. At the price level this restaurant is outstanding in my opinion. Book table in advance - they are hard to get!,19-Apr-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"After a lovely morning spent wandering around the Barrio de Las Letras a couple of weeks ago, we stumbled across this charming restaurant at lunchtime only to be disappointed on learning that it was fully booked. We ended up eating at La Vaca Veronica, a couple of doors down the road. This was a mistake. (OK meal but the owner was offensive and rude who deserves nobody's loyalty - full review to follow shortly!) However, this gem left a lasting and favourable impression. It just looks like a place where you will enjoy a great meal. Which is precisely what we did today after making a reservation. It was worth the wait. Moratin Vinoteca is a small, welcoming, cosy and understated space with a bookish look about it, accentuated by the well-chosen prints and shelves lined with art books and stylish bric-a-brac. No flourescent tubes to offend your eyeballs here. Lighting is underplayed and tasteful. It must be a treat to eat here in the evening, judging by previous reviews. All the design elements combine to lend the restaurant a wonderfully relaxed and relaxing atmosphere. The menu is short. But it is long in interest. Don't expect plates of curling jamon or slices of dried-out tortilla. This menu is full of the tantalising and unusual and wonderfully fresh. Prices are very fair with starters up to around 12 euros and most mains at around 14 euros. Be adventurous and be delighted. We couldn't decide between the tempting starters. So we chose two. The first was the remarkable tiny, juicy artichokes with olive oil and sal de cecina. Cecina is a delicious dried and cured beef that is appreciated throughout Spain and often served as an aperitivo. Here, to make the ""sal"" (salt) they grate it over the artichokes and the result is exquisite. A brilliant and surprising pairing that was delicate yet full of flavour.  Our second starter was mi-cuit of monkfish livers with baby broad beans. This, too, was full of subtlety and taste. The mi-cuit was much more restrained in flavour than goose or duck liver and you'd need to be told it was fish in a blind test. It was, like the previous dish, a blend of less-than-obvious and contrasting ingredients that combine to provide something irresistible. It's alchemy. My main was steak tartare. This may seem unadventurous when there are more inventive and interesting dishes on offer. But it's a dish that should only be chosen in the best restaurants. With no cooking to disguise inferior quality, its success - or failure - depends entirely on the quality of (literally) raw materials and the chef's restraint and skill in combining the meat with the few ingredients to produce a sublime dish. Here the dish is prepared in the kitchen (not in front of you as sometimes happens in more showy restaurants in France, for example) and it is served with a couple of small pieces of toast to provide some crunch to contrast with the succulent meat. I also chose the option of it being slightly more picante than usual. Good choice. It was as good as any steak tartare I have ever eaten. And that is a lot of very good raw meat to beat, if you get my drift. To choose steak tartare in any restaurant is to put your well-being in the hands of the chef. Red meat and egg needs to be very fresh to be eaten raw. Several hours later, as I write my review, I can safely report that the only ill-effect of having eaten this dish at lunchtime is that I am not eating it right now. Oh..and it produces an uncontrollable flow of saliva whenever it is remembered. Eat this if you like red meat. My wife chose the canneloni with carrilleras and vegetables. Carrilleras are pig's cheeks. This may sound unappetising to the uninitiated but it is one of the most delicious cuts of meat if treated correctly, which means cooking slowly and patiently to produce an incredibly tender and tasty meal. I had a taste and can vouch for this dish. Mouth-watering. We ended our meal with the superb chocolate coulant-filled sponge and a perfectly-judged sour cream that was distincty yoghurty.  Our choice of dishes called for a red although the warm spring weather on the day we ate here meant we didn't fancy anything too heavy. The chef/owner (?) recommended a bottle of Treintamil Maravedies. This is a young blend of Grenache, Tempranillo and Syrah from the Bodega Maranones in the Madrid region. It was elegant, and aromatic with a taste of red fruits and a little pepper while being smooth and rounded. It was perfect with our choice of dishes and very easy drinking. Not too hard on the pocket, either, at around 19 euros. Great advice, thanks chef. To top it all off we had two perfect coffees followed by a gin and tonic each. All this for around 90 euros. You won't find better value in Madrid. And that is saying something. Throughout our meal we had attentive but unobtrusive service from the waiter. The chef-owner (?) whose name I omitted to ask checked on our satisfaction on at least a couple of occasions and talked happily about his creations when prompted. No prompting needed to recommend this stellar restaurant, without reservation. Just don't forget to make a reservation.",12-Apr-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Every food course was exceptional, great bottle of wine and wonderful service. Extremely friendly service and advice.  The artichokes were amazing.  Be sure to reserve well in advance.",22-Feb-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This small restaurant is close to everything, yet a hidden gem. The food is wonderful, of a quality comparable to much ""fancier"" places, but this is no dive. It's an interesting decor, feels like fine dining, and the owner and staff are very attentive, warm, and responsive. Maybe the best quality per euro of our entire dining experience throughout Spain.",9-Mar-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This was our first night in Spain and what an amazing meal we had. The food and service were outstanding and the waiter was even kind enough to tolerate my Spanish. This is a very quaint and charming restaurant, but the food is the real star. ",10-Feb-15

Very good experience, absolutely suggested.",17-Jan-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We had dinner at Moratin Bistrot last night and it was a wonderful experience. Previous reviewers are spot on. The restaurant is small with well spaced tables and the menu is full of interesting Spanish dishes. The emphasis seems to be on high quality ingredients treated with care. Service is really excellent, friendly and helpful. We shared three dishes, an octopus starter, chicken with citrus and veal cheek cannelloni. All were fabulous, and the chef/owner? Told us the chicken was his grandmothers recipe. Wine was another stand out with many wines available by the glass, and a taste of each wine was offered before the glass was poured. We saw a few groups turned away, so you really must book. Highly recommended.",31-Dec-14

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Made a reservation about a week in advance and arrived as the first guests that night. Service was outstanding and food as well! They offered different wines for each course with the possibility to try first before they poured you the full cup. Food was excellent: as an entry we had some kind of leek roll, which was not overly exciting. I wanted to try it as I couldn't imagine what it would taste like and I would say they got about all the taste you can get out of leek, which still wasn't that much ;-) maybe go for another entry. As main courses we had caneloni and squid, which were both excelent. Personal highlight were the deserts: chocolate ""volcano"" and a sorbet of red fruits. The combination is killing!  Prices for the quality absolutely reasonable and again a really good service. As we got the check we asked for recomendations for the next night and we got about five different restaurants in different price categories. Ah yes the atmosphere: really nice! Small and personal!",3-Dec-14
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"In good weather, reserve a table by the terraza(outside). We were cared by Jose, fantastic and funny guy, that gave us a great experience.

La_Gaditana_Castellana,2,Negative,"We let the waiter advise us on what to order, and it was quite disappointing. We ordered out of the menu turbot for two (it could have been for three) and they let it cool down so by the time we ate it it was kind of cold. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the fish was okay but evidently not a 71‚Ç¨ turbot. We also ordered out of the menu white prawns, and were neither good enough for the price they had. Service was kind. Overall, the lunch was 130‚Ç¨ for two. I don‚Äôt believe we will come back.",10-Oct-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,Really good place for both meat and fish. We were 7 here and everyone find is happiness here.

Steve had artichokes for a starter which he reckons was the best starter he has ever had which is praise indeed. Marcos deserves his success as he is passionate about the food and wine he serves and it's his aim for customers to enjoy the experience of dining at his restaurant.",18-Apr-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"La noche en el barrio de las letras de Madrid tiene su encanto, pero aun m√°s si entras por la noche para cenar en este peque√±o restaurante. Una luz c√°lida y tenue, una musica agradable, camareros atentos, cena exquisita y una bodega no muy extensa (por suerte) pero envidiable. Si todo esto lo unes a una buena compa√±√≠a ten por cuenta que la noche saldr√° redonda.  El restaurantes se compone de unas 10 mesas bien distribuidas con un servicio excepcional y con una carta escueta y excelentemente elaborada con calidad suprema. Nos decantamos por unos primeros ligeros Puerros confitados con salsa romescu (que se desacian en la boca) y alcachofas con sal de cecina (s√≠, yo tampoco cre√≠a que esto se podia hacer)...algo maravilloso para el paladar. Con los segundos quer√≠amos probar de todo, pero yo al final decid√≠ que con el Caliza que estabamos tomando se merec√≠a un steak tartar (lo cual no decepcion√≥ para nada). Me acompa√±ante en cambio tir√≥ al pescado, una merluza al caba en papillote que estaba justo en su punto. Para el postre algo sencillo, una creme brulee para compartir (r√≠quisima y casera) Volver√© porque me qued√© con ganas de probar el cochinillo que cuando lo vi salir a la mesa de al lado me dejo con unas ganas tremendas y tambi√©n para probar el coulant de chocolate. The night in the neighborhood of the letters of Madrid has its charm , but even if you go at night for dinner at this small restaurant. A soft warm light and a nice music , attentive waiters , fine dining and not extensive wine card (thankfully) but enviable . If all this join it with a good company, the night will be perfect. The restaurant is made up of about 10 tables well spread with exceptional service and a brief letter and excellently made ‚Äã‚Äãwith supreme quality. We opted for first light dishes, Leeks confit with romesco sauce (soft on the palate) and artichokes with salt of cecina (yes, I also thought that this could be done) ... something wonderful for the mouth. With the seconds dishes I wanted to try them all , but I finally decided to try the steak tartare (which did not disappoint at all) . My companion, opted for the hake in the caba in foil that was made right in your point For dessert, something simple, a creme brulee to share (rich and homemade ) Back because I was eager to try the suckling pig when I saw him go to the next table left me with an overwhelming desire and also to try the chocolate Coulant .",11-Nov-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,We happened to rent an apartment just above this restaurant but it was booked for several days and we were unable to get in until Sunday. Staff was very helpful and even directed us to a restaurant after we couldn't get in on our first try. They speak so English and I speak some Spanish so we were able to get along fine. Food was very good. Expensive for what it was but so was everything in this neighborhood due to it's proximity to the museums and historic center.,13-Oct-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Sublime.  Superb.  Suckling pig to die for.  Perfect in every way.  Make a reservation for dinner, and take the time to really enjoy the place.",8-Oct-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,We stumble onto this restaurant and had the most delightful lunch.The owner went to great lengths to explain the dishes and there origins.More expensive then Tapas but well worth the visit.,27-Sep-13
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,This is one of those small restaurants lovingly cared for by its owner. We had the best meal of our trip on our last night in Madrid. Located on a small street not far from the prado the food was spanish and french inspired. the wine list is first rate. You must make a reservation well in advance.,27-Nov-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I found this place the last time I was in Madrid when I was walking through the neigborhood but couldn't get in - reservations are definitely required. The restaurant itself is smallish and unlike some places they don't have a tapas area or outdoor seating. Tables are nicely spaced such that you don't feel as though people are sitting on top of each other.  The staff was very friendly and spoke excellent English. When I asked them how large the portions were they said they were full plates, but also said that they could do half-portions of many of the dishes if I wanted try multiple things. They suggested several of their specials and explained why the specials were recommended. We choose Artichoke as the first dish, Octopus as the second and beef tartar for the main. The artichoke was the first of the season and was prepared very nicely with a light seasoning. For a half portion it was relatively large. The Octopus was by far the best I've ever had and I've had good octopus - they have some method of vacuum cooking for it that makes it tender all the way through without getting rubbery. Perfectly seasoned. The beef tartar was billed as one of the restaurants specialties and I enjoyed it very much. When I asked about wine for the dinner, they offered a pairing with half-glasses for each course. Started with a medium dry sherry with the Artichoke, a slightly sweeter Galician white for the octopus and a more robust red with the beef tartar. I then asked them for a glass of their favorite full-bodied red reserve which turned out to be quite delicious. A small dessert of cr√®me Catalan topped the whole thing off. All that and it was less than 50 Euros for the whole thing which I thought was outstanding considering the quality and what I had. This is going to be my #1 favorite small place in Madrid. (And I've eaten at several of the Michelin starred restaurants, all of which were also wonderful but cost more than 10x as much.) I can definitely side with the people that hesitated to write a review in order to keep the place secret but of course they need to keep their business running so it is only fair to review them.",3-Nov-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Small, intimate Madrid gem. Everything is carefully prepared and delicious. Amazing wine choices, great and friendly service. Must make a reservation if you want to get a seat. Lunch is the same menu as dinner. Highly recommended.",23-Oct-14
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"We had an excellent meal at La Gaditana Castellana. We were seated in the enclosed outdoor space, which was lovely and not too hot. We were well-taken care of by our server, Jose, who gave great recommendations and prepared our seared tuna dish beside our table with a beautiful presentation. He was also a total character and kept us well entertained throughout the meal. Highly recommended!",22-Sep-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,"We got a reservation at 20:00 and were almost the first party to be seated. The wait staff were very friendly, attentive and gave us good suggestions on what to order. However as the restaurant's fully packed with customers, they became a bit overwhelmed though they had already been working in a really fast pace. The meal started with a Salmorejo-like amuse bouche and olives, which were the best I have ever had. The food we ordered, in generous portion, was great. Caldero de Arroz (rice in Cauldron with red prawns) for 2 was actually enough for 4. We, 3 ladies, could hardly finish it. Though too salty for our liking, we could tell tonnes of flavour of the sea were packed in it. All other dishes we ordered like the steak, the Galician-style octopus, smoked sardines and the salad were good. The oysters weren't as good though coz they're not in season. We had ordered too much and had to pass the dessert. The meal costs ‚Ç¨125, which was reasonable. But the overall experience wasn't perfect, it took us a really long time to get the crazily busy wait staff to give us the check. It did tarnish our impression of the restaurant band that's why it's rated 4 instead of 5. Though I wonder if it's worth the detour to go there, I must admit that it's absolutely a popular dining place that offered high-quality food for locals and tourists alike.",3-Sep-19

La_Gaditana_Castellana,4,Positive,A fantastic small restaurant with really fresh fish. Wine selection was excellent and puddings as good as the food.

Eiffel,4,Positive,Im a Madrid citizen and i know a lot of restaurants here. Here you can find a traditional bar (as others in worker neighbourhouds) and a good restaurant. Its perfect if you want to know how are authentics bars and at the same time you want to have a good lunch. 6 courses menu for 25 euros and dayly menu for 10 euros.

La_Gaditana_Castellana,3,Negative,"We chose to visit La Gaditana Castellana based on reviews from TripAdvisor. While we were looking over the menu the waiter suggested a large fish that would feed our group of five. We agreed to the dish and asked how much this would cost. We were told that they needed to weigh the fish before they could give us a price and then we were told 39 Euros per Kilo. This is way overpriced for Sea Bass. The meal also came with boiled potatoes and a simple salad. The bottles of water were close to 4 Euros each and of course, we were charged a sitting fee. The fish was prepared as a two-sided filet with the thinner ends being cooked properly and the middle, thicker section needing to be cooked more. The service was excellent and very attentive to our needs but overall the meal was overpriced and we left not feeling great about the experience. We would not recommend this restaurant and will not return while we are visiting Madrid. ",19-Nov-19
La_Gaditana_Castellana,5,Positive,"Excellent traditional Spanish cuisine. The food was amazing, very welcoming- the place was edgy and nice for cocktails and the service was something else. German took amazing care of us and we will be back next week. Highly recommend.",17-Nov-19

This is the first restaurant that really warmly welcome non-Spanish speaker. So to say, 5 stars for service! Food is outstanding! Although, not the best thing I had in life, but it is the best in Madrid from my 3 days experiences. The best part is ""quality per euro"". With this price, this would be one of the best restaurant in Europe. I had a big meal, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine, dessert, 2 digestive shots, all of these for ‚Ç¨26.50.  Thanks, Miguel (the owner).

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Just a simple door on a side street. A step inside brings you to the best meal you'll have in Madrid. The attentive owners provide a small but varied menu prepared with passion and care. Each item we ordered was cooked to perfection. What a great experience. It was easy to make a reservation online and enough English was spoken to help us out. We were able to walk from our hotel as the restaurant is very near to the Opera House. Skip the tourist stops. Restaurant Algarabia will present a meal you won't forget.,18-Jul-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,This is really a most extraordinary restaurant that gets everything right. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by one of the sisters with her warm smile. Great conversations then continued. Wonderful Pate offered with bread we enjoyed our shrimp croquettes. My partner had succulent oxtail and I had the most fabulous baby squid stew. Wonderful chocolate raspberry dessert washed down with ‚Äúraisin tasting‚Äù sweet sherry! The cook (sister) came out at the end to meet us and more good conversations followed. They understand that a good restaurant is more than just the food..the ambiance; personal service and fun matter! They love what they are doing even after 24 years! A restaurant you must visit when in Madrid!,11-Jul-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I‚Äôve been here twice in as many years. The first time (May 2018) I had the tasting menu, which was delicious and ran about 2 hours. The second time I had a salad and main dish. The food is excellent, but the service is what makes this place special. Two sisters, Isabel and Pilar, work the front of house and kitchen, respectively. Isabel is a pro entertainer and puts you at ease right away (I was a single traveller, so it was very nice to be able to talk to her). At the end of the meal, Pilar comes out of the kitchen and makes her way from table to table to chat. I will definitely be back and in the meantime have recommended this place to all my friends.",8-Jul-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Every time I found myself in Madrid I try to find time for having dinner in this wonderful little restaurant. The kitchen is run by Pilar and the tables are Isabel‚Äôs kingdom. The food is prepared according to fresh market offer so you can get also little surprises in this sense. The atmosphere of the place is quite unique and it‚Äôs relaxing. Traditional dishes from the countryside culture and a touch of Mediterranean fish ( last time I had croquetas with red king prawn - dish of the day ) are served with kindness and knowledge. I suggest the experience in this little oasis when you look for a cozy evening and for serious good food.,8-Jul-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"Wanted to try something not touristy,very Spanish, we found this small restaurant. From the first moment we entered this place we felt a bit like visiting family,Isabel was very communicative, we was talking like old friends.Food we ordered was very good made withtop ingredients,house Rioja also ok:) Pilar is very good chef - a lot of experience, restaurant is working from almost 24 years. One thing we have to ask both sisters: 8‚Ç¨ for few slices of bread and 3.20‚Ç¨ for small cofee is too much, even for Madrid. Mucho suerte Se√±oras",30-Jun-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Excellent service, exquisite food from La Rioja and great location, one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in years. Also great chat with the owners, Isabel and Pilar, they are really fun and welcoming. Will come back for sure!",23-Jun-19
Eiffel,5,Positive,"I have rarely felt so welcome in a restaurant. My spanish is not very good and so when planning this trip i used a lot of google translate to set up things like tables reservations and the like. When i called to confirm my booking to Eiffel, it turned out i hadn't specified the date and they had held a table for me for hours the previous sunday. Despite this innauspicious start, the manager arrranged to transfer my booking with no problem, then when we arrived, welcomed us with delicious (and copious) tapas while we browsed the menu. All of the staff were friendly in a very paternal, family way. I more than once felt I had been eating here since I was a child.  I had mentioned off hand that it was my wife's birthday, when she went to powder her nose, the manager came to ask me her name and flashed a very cute little graphic around the restaurant's screens wishing her a happy birthday. While kitsch, it was done in such a cute and unassuming way that it was a great success. The food was good, the batter and oil were fresh. I had a delicious dish of whitefish stuffed with a mix of prawns peppers and possibly cod and for desert, a fried crepe filled with chocolate, delicious in a deepfried mars bar way.",9-Nov-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We spend a lot of time in Spain, but this was our first visit to Madrid, my wife left a review of Eiffel, but the food and and service were so good that I felt I should also leave a review.  There is not much I can add to June's review, we have eaten at restaurants all over the world and for food quality and service it is in my top ten, value for money makes it number one. The staff are friendly and helpful the food is amazing and original.",12-Oct-16
Eiffel,5,Positive,"We enjoyed our first night here so much that we came back the following evening. On both occasions we had the tasting menu, Miguel made a different one the second night. Priced at ‚Ç¨21 it was fantastic value & the food was amazing. Different, beautifully presented, tasty & fresh. Great wines too. However, what makes this restaurant special is the staff. Miguel the owner explained that it is a family business, with his mum in the kitchen & himself & 2 sisters in front of house. Add to that, the excellent Fernando & Natalia, the service & warmth they provide is exceptional, even to the extent of personalised menus, reservation cards & a photo on the screen. They genuinely want the customer to have a great experience, & whilst their claim to not be the poshest restaurant in Madrid may be true, I dispute the fact that they are not the best! In my opinion this restaurant is one of the best places we have eaten in Spain, & we have eaten at a lot. I could say more but I would only be reiterating what other positive reviewers have already said. To sum up, fantastic food at a great price with a wonderful atmosphere & lovely staff. Give it a try, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Hope to see you soon, Miguel, thanks for 2 lovely evenings.",9-Oct-16
Eiffel,3,Negative,This is a family run hole in the wall restaurant. The service is extremely friendly. The food is good (but not great). We had the avocado tartar which was made with hard avocadoes. Most everything is fried. The place is over Tripadvised. Number 3 in all of Madrid's 9000+ restaurants? I don't think so.,9-Oct-16
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"With only seven tables and a maximum capacity of twenty diners, this hidden gem right off the Opera metro stop was the highlight of our Madrid dining experience. The two sisters work so hard to deliver an authentic experience to their guests and their efforts show in everything you experience at this cozy restaurant. From the food, to the wine, to their hospitality, you don't feel like you're in a restaurant so much as you are a guest in their home.",19-Jun-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is just a terrific restaurant of a very specific type, located not too far from the Plaza Mayor. It is tiny, with seating for only 22 at seven tables. It is run by a total staff of two, sisters Isobel and Pilar, it is focused on Galician food that is well prepared and presented and it is thriving in its 23rd year. We‚Äôve found dinners there to be consistently excellent and the atmosphere is terrific, as long as you like being treated like a beloved and long lost member of the family. We started with a green salad with goat cheese, shrimp croquettes, and asparagus in filo dough. Then we each had an excellent fish dish. We closed things out with their extraordinary dessert, baked apple topped with toffee foam (it‚Äôs big enough to share but you‚Äôll want it all). We also had complimentary starters of liver and aubergine pate. We paired all of this with a reasonably priced, perfectly acceptable Rioja wine as suggested by Isobel. We will be back every time we‚Äôre in Madrid. ",18-Jun-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This wonderful and cozy place is definitely a must in Madrid, the food is astonishingly good, the quality of the service, the wine, just everything, is a 10 out 10, let's put it this way: this is the place I go when I'm trying to impress my date.",4-Jun-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive," The description of this restaurant as a small cozy restaurant run by two sisters, Isabel and Pilar , was the main reason my husband and I booked a table for dinner. The trip advisor reviews were also very positive. The restaurant was just as described: small, cozy, friendly, with a varied menu and good wine. Both the meal and the experience was PERFECT! Isabel was charming and Pilar came from the kitchen to greet guests at the end of the evening. Both my husband and I want to send a personal "" thank you"" to both sisters. Thank you Isabel for being so patient and kind with us due to our delayed travel plans the day of our reservation. You made us feel relaxed and welcome. The dinner was just what we needed after a very long travel day. Pilar, thank you for a wonderful meal.  Our experience at Algarabia was one of the highlights of our two weeks in Spain. Isabel and Pilar, thank you both for creating a lasting memory. You will see us again the next time we visit Madrid.",6-Nov-19

Thank you so much ladies x",3-Nov-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We chose to spend our last night in Madrid here, and are so happy we did. The food was outstanding, from the vegetable pate that started our meal to the two desserts that ended it, as was the wine (don't even think about drinking anything other than Rioja).  We had the tasting menu, and because I dawdled in writing this review, I don't remember every course. The highlights were the croquetas (de carabineros - feather light but amazingly, intensely shrimpy) and the fish course (cabracho, a kind of rockfish - and Isabel, if you're reading this, si, tenemos algo parecido en nuestro lado del Atlantico, pero la gente aqui no lo aprecia y por supuesto, no sabe cocinarlo como Pilar!).  As good as the food was - and it was VERY good - the really special thing about this restaurant are the two sisters who run it and imbue it with their personalities. Isabel, the front of the house, explains the menu and isn't afraid to be a little bossy if she sees you about to do something that's going to detract from your experience (like not drinking Rioja, or eating the intense dark chocolate dessert before the apple toffee one). Pilar, the cook, comes out of the kitchen toward the end of the evening (dinner is a leisurely, one-seating affair) to make the rounds and chat with her guests.  Because that's really how Isabel and Pilar make you feel - like guests at their dinner party.",2-Nov-19

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Isabel and Pilar are sisters; Pilar cooks and Isabel hosts. We felt like we were in their living room, as the cozy room emanates warmth and only has seven tables. We chose this place because we wanted authentic Spanish food. We were not disappointed. Pilar cooked a memorable meal! The cod cakes were mouthwatering. My husband had a vegetable appetizer with green beans and mushrooms that was delicious. We chose codfish in tomato sauce for the main dish. Dessert was a light chocolate concoction that was like a wafer. Isabel was delightful and Pilar came out after the meal to ask how everything was. This was a memorable experience. Isabel walked us to the taxi stand, as I was concerned about getting one. I plan to go back to Madrid and visit this special place once again!",16-Oct-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The TripAdvisor reviews are accurate. This small but marvelous restaurant is a joy. Great food, Isabel the co- owner with the chef, her sister Pilar make the evening not to miss. The food and house wine make for a very pleasant combination of flavors. First was a complementary pate of duck, pork and chicken combined with their crisp and warm bread slices. Perfect. Then we started with the croquettes which come 6 to a portion. 2-4 people can share this rich starter. Very tasty!! On to the main course. We had the oxtail which is a large portion as was the brazed pork medallions. Each was really large enough for two. Perfectly cooked. The house red is delicious and paired perfectly. Finally dessert of poached pears in wine with mascarpone. Isabel and Pilar joined at the end for pictures. The restaurant seats maybe 16. Reservation are really needed. They open at 9:30pm.

El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"I would rate this restaurant a 5 if they had not made us wait so much between the first and second courses, it was way too long, and the service was not the best (not bad either). The eighties music was a big turn off for the beautiful place and great food. The menu included many of the current fads you find everywhere, burrata, tuna tartare etc On the positives, beautiful well decorated place, great wine selection and amazing food. Very happy to find interesting (and yummy) signature dishes like the Boletus with poached eggs I am very demanding with food, especially with Peruvian dishes, and every one of the plates we ordered - including the ceviche was outstanding. Bravo to the Chef.",18-Dec-15

Isabel was welcoming and informative and Pinar‚Äôs cooking is superb. We especially enjoyed the pate, the duck confit salad and both fish dishes that we had. The crunchy chocolate and raspberry cake was amazing too. Do try to visit Algarabia when in Madrid. ",13-Sep-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,"Attended a cocktail party here. The small plates that were served included the croquetas, calamari, ensalilla rusa and salmon. All dishes were amazing. Service was impeccable. Will return for dinner !",10-Dec-15
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"Nice quality food, good atmosphere and nice decoration make this restaurant a place to come back, it is priced reasonably too so i quite recommend this place.",16-Nov-15
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"First time in this restaurant, we decided after a long day of shopping to have lunch. The venue was modern and chic, menu was not very big but food was tasty, well presented and had a good selection of spirits and wine. My waiter was really forgetful and got a little annoying after a while.  I would go again next time I am in Madrid",16-Oct-15
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,Absolutely great service and amazing food.  We have returned multiple times over the course of the summer and have never been disappointed!!,21-Jul-15
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"This is a new place in the city, that I found by chance, hadn¬¥t heard about it before. Quite modern decoration, good food, good quality/price ratio, service not so good, gives the impression they¬¥re still coordinating themselves. Over all, you get the feeling they try to do things well, also taking care of the customer, something I really did appreciate. Interesting",28-Apr-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Isabel and Pilar were the sweetest, and the food was excellent! We celebrated our first Anniversary here and they took great care of us. If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic, special experience‚Äî this is your place. This is NOT a small, pretentious dish type of place. It feels like you‚Äôve been welcomed into their home here- with generous serving sizes and meals made from the heart. Also, maybe our dinner was unique but there was comraderie with the other (four) tables there since it was such an intimate setting. Gracias por todo!",7-Sep-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I like it , because the food is good, fresh and the wine is cold. The dessert is also, good. Do not esitate  A little part of Spain at your table. The service is prompt and the prices are ok.",4-Sep-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We used to live in Madrid, and whenever we go back, we always make time for a visit to Algarabia. The food is incredible. From the best croquetas Madrid has to offer, to the unforgetable ox's tail; the food here is sophisticated yet humble, and always delicious.  However, more than just the food (and the lovely Riojan red wine 'de la casa'), is the quality of the sisters who run this small, intimate restaurant: Pilar and Isabel. I encourage you to pay them a visit, you won't regret it.",23-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,One of my favourite places to have authentic Rioja region food. The croquetas de carabineros are incredible! Isabel and Pilar make it a truly magical experience. A must go if you are in madrid!,20-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I know this restaurant for at least 5 years now, and every time I come back is better. Dishes are delicious and service is excellent. A must in Madrid!",19-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"A friend recommended Algarabia and we are happy he did. After a warm welcome by Isobel we setled in (only 7 tables so make a reservation). Three of us each had a fish entree (the squid stew was the best) and had to share bites with each other, it so was so good. House wine is good and reasonably priced. Save room for desert...apples with toffee foam is heavenly. Isobel and her sister Pilar (the cook) are a lot of fun. This was our first trip to Madrid but we may have to go again just for the dinner. Very reasonably priced. Just steps from the Opera House (plaza great for people watching before and/or after dinner)",11-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My wife and I had only picked a few places to eat in Madrid. Most places were fine, but none of them held a candle to Algarabia. It‚Äôs a small boutique restaurant run by two sisters. In Centro Madrid it‚Äôs hard to separate the tourist a attractions from the real deal: this place could easily be both. The food is great, and set apart from the other restaurants. And it‚Äôs a small lovely space that has intimate seating. One sister waits on the tables, while the other one is the chef in the kitchen. After our meal, we were ready to check out but one of the sister said that the chef would love to come and introduce herself, perhaps because we kept praising everyone of their plates . Since the food was amazing of course we waited to meet the chef, we had a lovely conversation. We can‚Äôt wait to come back! We recommend to start with the croquette. The chicken and pork dish was amazing my wife and I shared both. And we finished with the cooked pear, it was the perfect dessert that isn‚Äôt ice cream or chocolate  Hands down and easily one of our favorite meals here in Madrid. Don‚Äôt miss this small, but cute hole in the wall!",10-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I could not expect nothing better! The small restaurant with very few tables, offers a great selection of Rioja‚Äôs dishes, directly made by the chef Pilar in the kitchen; you can seriously hear her while mixing the ingredients for your meal! Her sister Isabel welcomes you in the restaurant with her big smile and typical Spanish vibe. Great dinner, great food, great location and great atmosphere! If you‚Äôre in Madrid, you MUST visit this restaurant!",10-Aug-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This place is absolutely unique! You can‚Äôt miss it! The atmosphere is cozy and extremely charming,The owner, Isabelle is f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s, the food excellent. It feels like a warm embrace in their amazing culture.",10-Aug-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We have been twice to this restaurant for dinner, and been very impressed on both occasions. It is a small, intimate place and bookings are essential. The staff speak English, go to great lengths to explain the intricacies of the various dishes, and will go out of their way to accommodate you - we had shared first and second courses which they plated up separately, for instance. The wine list is equally inviting. In three months in Madrid we have not had a better meal than here - certainly the best octopus we have had in Spain.",12-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,"Service was superb, great wine selection, food overall good, highlights the roast chicken and tomato soup. Deserts average, romantic music selection.",7-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,3,Negative,"We visited this restaurant based on the extremely high TripAdvisor reviews, but I do not feel that it deserves such a high rating. We came at lunch time without a reservation and were immediately seated. The customer service here was impeccable from both waiters (waiter/ma√Ætre) that we interacted with. We were walked through the menu, given suggestions, etc, all in a very friendly manner. The food was, on the whole, decent. My girlfriend had a tomato soup (good), and their cod (very good, although the vegetables it came with were cooked to death). I had a leek starter (disappointing) and the veal cheek cannelloni (average). The Catalan cream dessert was sad (though in fairness, it will always pale in comparison to the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, regardless of the restaurant). Overall, this restaurant makes for a decent stop for lunch or (presumably) dinner, but you should adjust your expectations going in. The food is unlikely to blow your mind. The decor is nice, but the value for money is quite poor.",3-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I am not sure when or how I stumbled across a newspaper review of Vinoteca Moratin, but it stuck with me and when we booked our trip to Madrid, I chose our accommodations based on their proximity to this restaurant---we were across the street! I was blown away by the quality of the food and service. I made reservations in advance per all of the reviews here. Marcos gracioulsy put up with my bad Spanish; he and other staff speak English very well. When we arrived we were greeted with warm and enthusiasm. The establishment is very small, maybe 8-10 tables, if that---hence the reason why you must make reservations. I was surprised that Marcos handles the bookings, is also the chef, AND he comes to each table to explain the menu and make recommendations! Since this was our first proper meal in Madrid, we splurged. We ordered the soup, the salmon, the porcini mushrooms, the veal cheek cannelloni and the cod. Each bite was heaven. I really recommend the salmon, it's marinated for three days in salt and sugar, served cold with a delicious green sauce. My husband's veal cheek was out of this world, and my cod was perfection.  Our waitress was outstanding. She made recommendations for wine. We love wine, but are not savvy. We described what we drink usually, and she brought two samples. both were amazing. We also enjoyed several glasses of cava. I was thrilled to talk to Marcos about the amazing cauliflower cream served with the porcini mushrooms.  I loved that dinner was unhurried and relaxed. The prices were very reasonable--cheap, in fact, for the high quality of the meal and service. This was truly a lovely evening.",3-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A delightful experience from the minute we walked in. Our host, fluent in English, took great care to describe each and every item on the menu and answered all our questions.  After enjoying an aperitif we treated to their Puerros confitados con romesco, delightfully tender leaks in a wonderful sauce. Our competent server, Olivia, brought a complimentary sampling of their marinated salmon of the the highest sashimi grade. Awesome! At the suggestion of our host we delayed having a second small plate of rich porcini mushrooms until after our main. The steak tartare was absolutely perfect with a slightly spicy blend of ingredients - the best I had ever enjoyed. My wife chose the fish special of the day, a tender, moist sea bass which was flavorful and blessed with a tasty sauce. Moratin Vinoteca offers an expansive wine list with many selections available by the glass. The service was absolutely perfect and the ambiance comfortable and relaxed. A really fantastic experience! Be certain to make reservations well in advance! During the course of our two-hour dining experience at least 25 people had to be turned away. We look forward to a future visit to delightful Madrid and this spot will be at the top of our ""must do"" list.",31-Oct-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We choose Algarabia based on the reviews and it's close proximity to our hotel near the Plaza de Espana.for our final evening in Madrid. It was cold and windy when we arrived for an early dinner, by Madrid standards, at 10:00 PM due to our early flight the next day. Having just opened, the door was still locked and the very elegant and stylish Isabel greeted us and ushered us into the softly lit and romantic dining room of a beautiful old house resplendent with candlelight and soft music. Isabel is the Spanish version of Antie Mame, she's witty and charming and just slightly mad in the most delicious way ... we knew it was to be a special evening right away! We started with a perfectly chilled glass of Cava and enjoyed the house pate and delicious bread while browsing the menu. Isabel explained the menu in her inimitable style keeping us both laughing, and she is fiercely proud of the Rioja region and it's wonderful food. We both choose the Degustacion menu and were impressed with not only the quality of the food but also by the expert and beautiful presentation. We went with the house Rioja that's bottled specially for Algarabia and it was perfect with our meal, dry and medium body but rich and aromatic as is typical of Riojas. The evening was a whirl of great food and wine and conversation and more wine and all presided over by Isabel while Pilar performed her magic in the kitchen. The crispy asparagus was incredible as were the croquettes, and Spain is known for it's croquettes. What was supposed to be an early evening turned into a late evening as the equally charming and beautiful Pilar joined us and before long we felt like long lost friends. Madrid is one of our favorite cities and now Algarabia is our favorite restaurant in Madrid. Algarabia is a must for anyone that appreciates local cuisine and values service and attention to detail and at a very affordable price. It was not just a wonderful meal but also about making friends and memories! Thank you Isabel and Pilar and we hope to see you in Miami in February...",22-Dec-13

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We have eaten at Moratin the last two years during our visit to Madrid. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, as others have that preceded me. The ingredients are of the best quality, expertly prepared, and presented. The food is innovative. The service is excellent. The owner is passionate about his food, and is also knowledgable about wines. If you want to eat dinner here, get reservations. To have a full course dinner with food and wine of this quality, for under a 100 Euro for two people is very rare. ",12-Oct-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Booked Algarabia for my wife's 'special' birthday with friends based on Trip Advisor feedback and we had a brilliant night. The food was excellent (tasting menu), really good value and the atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. Isabel was the perfect hostess with a very warm welcome and an excellent explanation of the menu whilst Pilar worked miracles in the kitchen. The entire meal was delicious and the selected Rioja was superb but not expensive. The evening ended with my wife being given a small gift as a birthday present - such a lovely touch. As and when we return to Madrid the Algarabia will be top of our list of restaurants. The Trip Advisor feedback fully supports our experience.",1-Apr-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Small and intimate restaurant where you can find excellent food and make new friends as the place is welcoming and warm. The service is so friendly and passionate about food and wines. Book in advance,27-May-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"A perfect setting for a wonderful meal, tucked away in a small road near Opera. The hosts were very welcoming with a useful grasp of English. The food and wine selection was first class.",25-Jan-18
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Book far ahead for dinner reservations to avoid disappointment. We couldn't get dinner reservations but Marcos squeezed us in for lunch the next day. Steak tartare was delicious. The gazpacho was okay but tasty as was Iberian ham carpaccio.,2-Jul-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A cozy, dimly lit, & intimate dining space, this restaurant was, hands down, our favorite dinner in Madrid. Let's start with basics: reservations are a Must. There's only seating for 28-32 so your chances of getting a walk in table are virtually nil. They are also closed Sunday and Monday While small in size they have kept their diners comfort in mind by not squeezing tables everywhere. The tasteful artwork on the wall is thoughtfully displayed and you truly feel as if you're dining in someone's home. Our party of four began our meal with some delicious apertifs including a dry Cava and a yummy vermouth. Pours throughout the evening were generous and the small staff of three were welcoming, gracious and competent. English was spoken with varying degrees of fluency but language proved to be no barrier as their good will and desire to make their customers happy seemed paramount. To begin, a complimentary platter of potatoes and a small basket of toothy olive bread - the first hint that we were in for a special dinner. Appetizers included a warm tomato soup that was declared the best tomato soup ever made anywhere. Leek confit, cooked so well it tasted more like white asparagus, with no bitterness at all and an in-house cured salmon. A mid course of super savory mushrooms over a cauliflower puree was sublime. Mains included a citrus drenched roast chicken and a hearty serving of veal cheek cannelloni, imagine your grandmother's best recipes presented in an updated way without fuss or pretense. Prices are moderate but considering the quality of the ingredients, the kitchen's talents, the server's expertise, Moratin Vinoteca Bistrot is worth every penny. If planning a trip to Madrid, be sure to make a reservation.",30-Oct-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Could eat here every day! Passion, high quality, and great service. A must visit if you appreciate good food",25-Oct-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This tiny gem, blocks from our hotel, the Westin Palace, specializes in the best farm-to-table ingredients, lovingly presented by the owner who explained every dish and wine choice to us. I think we were the only non-locals there, but we were welcomed like old friends. The food and wine choices blew us away with their nuanced flavors. Madrid is a city of exceptional restaurants, and we sampled many of them, but the Moratin Vinoteca Bistrot remains in our memory as the best food and the warmest people running it! It was also very reasonably priced for the exceptional quality.",24-Oct-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Everything was freshly sourced and so tasty! Smallish plates, but not expensive, so just order at will. Tomatoes, steak tartare and canelones were outstanding!

Highly recommend putting this restaurant on your dining radar! All around great experience. Thank you Marcos.",13-Oct-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We were early. Not that early, but we were there perhaps 15 minutes before they opened. Nevertheless they noticed us waiting outside, brought us in and served us probably the best meal we had in Madrid. My teenage son still talks about the p√¢t√©. My spouse's numerous food allergies were carefully considered and plates adjusted, and even so the food was wonderful.",21-Dec-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I was in Madrid on a weekend break and made my reservation for this restaurant before I left UK. What a wonderful lunch I had. Isabel and Pilar are two lovely ladies, and it was a pleasure to meet them and even more so, to enjoy such a meal in cosy surroundings, and kind hospitality, I wish them continued success.",15-Dec-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Last week I was in Madrid for business and went again to dinner by Pilar and Isabel. What a welcome I got. The food was great but the company if possible even better. I decide not to order but to let them surprise me. After all if you go at dinner by someone you get what the host decide. This approach removed also the problem of choosing. I always have a lot of doubts, there are too many things tempting me in their menu. They surprised me with some vegetables typical of their region and with a stuffed tomato. Nothing ""fancy"", but all very good and pleasant. Coupled with their good wine and lot speaking was a good way to finish a working day and brought a smile in a otherise lonsemoe evening.",1-Dec-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"Cosy, homely restaurant on a quiet side street with extremely friendly owners. I showed up at 9:00PM and found out that they open only at 9:30PM.

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My friend and I (both from New York City) read about this place on TripAdvisor (#24 best restaurant in Madrid) and decided to check it out and it was the best meals we've ever had in Spain. The two sisters that run the restaurant are super friendly and amazingly talented. It is a small, intimate place that only seats ~15 guests. They served complimentary fresh bread and house pate which was incredible. We ordered the croquettes and the chorizo scrambled eggs to start and both were amazing, but the chorizo eggs were life-changingly good.  For entres we each had the pork tenderloins with caramelized onions and this was also an incredible dish and was the best pork I've ever had. Needless to say if I return to Madrid, this will be the first place I come back to. The food, service, and hospitality were all A+",28-Sep-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"It feels as though you are in the living room of the sisters that run this restaurant- there are 7 tables, they write your Cheque by hand & you get a double kiss on the way out.

Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"We were SO excited to try this place and we're so very let down. It is very cute and homey - seating about 20 people. The owner and the chef are so cute but it is as if your grandma cooked you a meal and you had to pretend to like it. We paid $106 total for a bottle of wine, two apps, two mains, and one dessert. We sent back a main as it was not good at all - made me feel sick - and they still charged us.  Honestly, after eating our way through Madrid and Barcelona, this was one of the more expensive dinners and by far the worst. I was so excited to enjoy a nicer dinner in Madrid and this was a let down.  Hate to disagree with all the reviews here, but as a foodie who enjoys finding the next hidden gem - this is not it. (Despite the adorable sister owners and ambiance).",12-Sep-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This is a very small restaurant run by two sisters - one being a chef and the other taking care of guests.

Algarabia stands for 'enjoyment' in Spanish - you will really enjoy the evening, atmosphere and hospitality.",9-Sep-17

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Loved this restaurant, they are so passionate about their food. The chef comes to the table to explain how they cook every item on the menu and makes recommendations based on what is in season. You want to order everything when he describes it ! We ordered 6 dishes between the 4 of us and had them all to share, tapas style in the middle of the table. They just told us to choose and they would plan the meal for us so we ended up with the equivalent of two starters, tender confit leeks and marinated salmon, then two fish dishes, low temperature cod, and the fish of the day (a delicious mackerel dish) followed by two meat dishes, steak tartare (just the right balance) and a wonderful slow cooked veal cannelloni. the desserts sounded so good that we couldn't resist a chocolate cake with chocolate sauce in the middle with raspberry and violet ice cream and a stunning dense creamy cheesecake. Book a table, we loved it.",22-Sep-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We walked in early on a Weds evening without a booking. Although empty, it was fully booked for the evening, but we were lucky that Marcos allowed us to have a table before its 1030pm reservation. And how lucky we were! Marcos and Olivia, our waiters, were superb. Full explanation of the key dishes on the small but perfect menu. Excellent choice of wines by the glass to accompany the 5 tapas style courses we shared. And great humour throughout. A lovely experience. And the food.... tomatoes so ripe and flavourful that they were a treat. Leeks braised with a fantastic tomato sauce to accompany, cod beautifully cooked, and the real triumph of the veal cannelloni.  After all that, the bill was very reasonable too. Would I go back? Absolutely - every time I visit Madrid! ",21-Sep-17

Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"Ok, let me start with this. It pains me to write this review, as I had SUPER high hopes for this place based on the incredible reviews on Tripadvisor. I know it is 2 sisters running it and I commend them on their efforts and wish them success, but this place was not for me. I thought for sure this place would blow me away and would become part of my regular rotation on trips to Madrid. I went with my friend and mother during a recent trip. We made reservations for the first slot of the evening and showed up about 10 minutes early. The lady who runs the front of the house made a little joke about it not quite being the time yet, but sat us. The d√©cor of the room is odd, to say the least. It is like sitting in someone's living room, except that someone is your 95 year old grandmother and she has been collecting bric a brac for years. There were strange pictures on the wall that did not fit, and it seemed like a cramped old house. I ordered the rabbit pasta, which was terrible. It had slivers of bone in every other bite, which made it very difficult and not enjoyable to eat. The wrapped and friend asparagus were salty and greasy and not that impressive. My mother had the mushroom soup, and found it to salty for her. When the lady came by and noticed she had not eaten it, she asked if there was an issue, and my mother told her it was too salty for her, to which the hostess replied, that lady over there is eating it, and it is excellent, it isn't too salty. Not exactly the kind of response I want, especially when we don't even complain without you asking. Don't ask if you don't want to know. On the positive note, my mother had a tuna entr√©e which she said was actually very good. I forget what my friend had, but I recall he was not pleased, and overall, the meal was eminently forgettable. We also had some shrimp croquetas, which were mediocre at best (go the Guadarrama to La Chimenea for croquetas). After all, I did not even order dessert, which is spain is a sin for me. The meal was very pricey and the food was just not good. I am baffled at the reviews here. Overall, service was decent and polite, if not the most agreeable, the food was not good and overpriced and the d√©cor was cramped and offputting. For that kind of money, hell, for even less money, there is WAY better food to be had all over Madrid.",25-Mar-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My wife, daughter and I went her for our last meal in Madrid. It was one of our best. the place is run by two sisters, one in the kitchen and one up front. The total experience is very nice. The dining room is a bit dark (my daughter said it was like a funeral parlor), but we thought it was very romantic. The place was full and very small. It appears they only do one seating a night. We had the tortilla, which was very good, as were the croquettas. We also had the veal stuffed tomatoes, which were delicious. The leeks and duck confit was the best dish I had in Spain. The octopus was great. The wine was very good and reasonable. The cook comes out at the end of the night and greets the guests, and the final ticket is hand written by the other sister. the place opens at 930, and for 3 with 3 tapas, 3 main courses and two desserts and wine, it was 127E. I would recommend it.",24-Mar-14

The staff were so friendly & helpful- we booked well in advance as it gets booked up very quickly since it's a smallish place. It's nicely decorated & has a very friendly atmosphere. Our booking was done by email & they had remembered that my daughter was "" gluten free"" & when the bread arrived they brought rice cakes instead - we were very impressed. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal & it made finding other restaurants for our next two nights hard to live up to !!!!!! Would have no hesitation in recommending . A lovely meal enjoyed by us all.",28-Apr-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A great little place on a quiet street close to the museums. The menu is a bit ""narrow"", but the food was delicious enough and the wine list has some excellent items on it. But the best thing about this place was definitely the service. It was friendly and professional and made us feel welcome. This place is apparently very popular, at least at lunch time, so you might want to make reservations.",21-Apr-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Not only is the food heavenly, but the ambience is relaxing and the design and lighting are warm and subtle. We especially enjoyed the chef's personal explanation of each dish, in both English and Spanish. He obviously loves cooking for his customers and sharing the pleasure he gets from creating delicious dishes. To top it all off the prices are very reasonable and the service impeccable. I highly recommend this restaurant.",18-Apr-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We were fortunate to celebrate my son's 13th birthday at Algarabia. The chef, Pilar, worked with me months prior to the event to plan a perfect menu for twelve. Each Rioja course was better than the next. The croquettes, pate, soup, fish, veal and dessert were gourmet delicacies. Pilar's sister, Isabel, works the front part of the restaurant and makes you feel as if you are dining at their home. We went for dinner and left with new friends. Don't miss the opportunity to experience Algarabia!",13-Jan-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We selected Algarabia for our first evening in Madrid based on the reviews, our friends' recommendations and proximity to our hotel. We were warmly greeted upon arrival at 2200 with a hug and a kiss by our exuberant hostess Isabel. The charming salon is warmly lit and very inviting, the tables spaced to allow for intimate and romantic dining. The tantalizing aromas wafting from Chef Pilar's kitchen further set the mood as we were very hungry after a long day's night of travel. Feeling adventuresome after an icy cold glass of Cava we opted to let Chef Pilar surprise us with some of her off menu specials of the evening, and the David Moreno house Rioja. We began our journey thu Rioja with salmon mousse served in martini glass and topped with a luscious watercress cream. Next wonderfully fresh seasonal artichokes sauteed with Iberic ham. Then light as air lentils and foie gras, oh my! What followed next was a totally unexpected regional and seasonal Rioja dish of borrajas, similar to a very tender kale, sauteed with angulas which resemble tiny and delicate chanterelles and river crayfish.. stunningly simple yet amazingly satisfying. The finale was our favorite protein other foie, Iberian pork cheeks in a seductive Jerez sauce. Altough all our courses were plated to share we felt compelled to waive the white flag at this point and almost decided to forgo dessert, that is until Isabel brought us pears cooked in Rioja served with a mascarpone sauce. Dessert of course led to expreso's and then of course agua ardiente.. By now it was 0130 and we needed to stagger back to our hotel to recuperate. As we were the last guests that evening Chef Pilar and Isabel both escorted us out but not before more warm hugs and a kisses.. Thank for such an enchanting and sumptuous evening! Viva Rioja!!",3-Dec-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,"Madrid is not necessarily a place for dinners where you feel you've escaped. There are always people around to create a certain din in the room. This restaurant is tiny with less than 20 seats and doesn't have an accompanying bar scene, so it's a very different atmosphere from the usual Madrilean, city-center establishment. Not that it's dead quiet! The waitress (who is also the owner, along with her sister - the chef), is quite chatty but in a great way if you like characters that will converse on any subject and that are genuinely curious about their patrons opinions and experiences. People that like to stick to talking to their dining partners only will not appreciate this aspect of the visit here. Our opinion: if you've spent your trip with the same person you're dining with, you probably can use a conversation with someone else. Food is based on cuisine from Rioja, their native region. On the saucier side than most regional dishes, which is great for dipping their bottomless basket of bread. Standout dishes were: their signature asparagus, which was simple and perfectly cooked; the housemade pate; their Riojan snails in sauce; and the shrimp croquettes, which are not for people who prefer frozen, tasteless shrimp because these taste like they came out of the sea. For the price, their house wine from Rioja is perfectly acceptable. Allot a couple of hours to enjoy the various courses. Recommend booking ahead as it's so small.",30-Nov-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Mollejas con patatas was very special house wine excellent as well as orujo from NavarraSisters are super, place was homey and ellegantCentrally located near Opera",26-Nov-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"What a find this place is! A great one to know about...run by two sisters...one is the greeter and one is the chef. You immediately have a sense of being part of the family, and are treated royally. It's obviously a very ""insider"" place and one feels privileged to be dining there. Home cooking at its best, no matter what you order. It's worth the experience just to enjoy such an intimate setting in a homey atmosphere.",14-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We booked this place by email from Seville and after a number of try's we were able to get a booking that suited our short stay in Madrid. It is so popular that getting a table is nearly impossible unless you plan ahead. As would be expected with a restaurant with such a high rating. Every aspect of the evening was perfect, the friendly waiter, the effervescent chef who personally talked us through his menu and his accompanying wine choice made the night an outstanding success. One of the best dining experiences in our 3 week gastronomic tour of Spain. The freshest ingredients, outstanding plating and service. Highly recommended.",1-Jul-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We booked a lunch slot in Moratin Vinoteca following a Guardian travel article recommendation. Take the Metro to Anton Martin stop and it is down Calle Moratin. The Bistrot is small about 10 tables and decorated with contemporary art. The staff were spot on. The maitre d was simply the best, arriving at our table to pour wine exactly at the right moment, clearing dishes, taking orders etc. The chef Gil came out to talk to us to recommend a local Madrid wine to go with our meal and explain the menu. I asked if he did a taster menu and he said not but to order 2 dishes and share between the four of us. Do we did this 3 times. We started with leeks with a sauce on the side and marinated salmon with pickled vegetables. The salmon was so fresh it melted. We followed with a portion of cod and a portion of hake cooked in paper. The cod was good but the hake was exceptional. The next course was veal cheek stuffed pasta and chicken thighs in a sauce. Gil told us that the chicken thighs came from a chicken that originated in Essex. The recipe was his Grandmothers chicken recipe which he had tweeked slightly, so very tasty. The next course was chocolate fondant to die for with creme fraiche, bliss! We finished with a coffee and white port. An amazing team delivering the best service and best food hopefully we will return but book well ahead to get a table! With two bottles of wine, 6 dishes, 3 puddings, 2 glasses of cava, 2 glasses of cava, one coffee, 2 white ports 2 beers the bill came to a crazy ‚Ç¨170.28!! See the photo for full details of cost.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We had great meal here, Lovely room, great staff and good food. The chef's enthusiasm and descriptions of his dishes at the table were a real delight.",25-Jun-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,This restaurant was near our hotel and we only found it on the last day of our holiday. On future trips this will be pre-booked before we leave home. It's a very small restaurant so booking ahead for dinner is a must. Whilst we were there so many people who hadn't booked were disappointed. The owner of the restaurant is charming and his love of food is infectious. He spends a lot of time at each table discussing the menu and wines. We chose the tasting menu but even then the scope to leave out some or order as you go along is unusual but a great idea. We skipped lunch anticipating our dinner here and were so glad we did. We tried everything! The chef suggested we shared some dishes as we told him we wanted to try it all. The wines were magnificent and complemented the food. Desserts and coffees and digestifs were all delicious. I can't praise this restaurant or the staff highly enough. It had been three years since our last visit to Madrid but I may just jump on a plane to enjoy this restaurant again. Better than many Michelin starred restaurants we have tried.,25-Jun-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"After 10 days of dining at multiple places in Madrid, my friends and I  felt that this was the best. The chef/owner is friendly and engaging . His descriptions of the menu items clearly reflect his passion for the process. It seems obvious that he treats it like a work of art which is well reflected in the presentation and the delicious taste. His recommendations for wine were right on target. We dined there twice and thoroughly enjoyed both occasions. Making reservations is a must for the restaurant capacity is limited. The leeks were delicious , the octopus melted in our mouths, the grilled chicken using the family recipe was tasty,.... It was all excellent! I will be making reservations for my next trip to Madrid.",23-Jun-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Delicuous and very tasty meal, really enjoyed the character and staff at the restaurant, would definetly go back :)",15-Jun-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,Algarabia is a very good place to dine. The restaurant itself is extremely cosy and comfortable. The service we received was exceptional. The two owners are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. The food was good but not exceptional. The value and prices are very reasonable. All in all we enjoyed our time here.,7-Nov-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We spent two and a half weeks eating our way through Spain. We ate at five Michelin stared restaurants and I would rank Algarabia in the top tier for flavor. It's elevated home cooking, nothing too fancy but great food. The restaurant has the look and feel of eating at your grandmother's home. Isabel runs the front of house and her sister Pilar is the chef. That sentence is deceiving, they are the only people working there and they do everything. The sisters are from the Rioja region (the best food in Spain) and they make great food from their childhood. They even had wine bottled for their restaurant, I think it was from their family vineyard. Isabel's English and our Spanish was lacking but once we got her talking we had a lot of fun. This was a perfect way to end our trip and definitely one of our favorite meals. In regards to the negative reviews. Think of this restaurant like going to your grandmothers for dinner. You would not show up last minute with five friends and expect your grandmother to prepare a Thanksgiving type meal. They are just two people so book well in advance so they can shop and prepare. The whole evening they served a total of nine people and I think that is close to their limit.",18-Oct-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Excellent representation of Spanish cuisine (and wine!), we opted for a ""tasting"" menu, to sample the best of everything and we were not disappointed ! A very warm welcome and a laid back atmosphere, could not have asked for more (apart for the recipe for the pate we had) !  Thank you ladies! ",18-Oct-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"The two ladies of this cozy , tiny , familiar restaurant went that night from a meeting of the rioja wine council . Maybe this was the reason why her short menu become shorter and badly cooked ... no pork or lamb hands (flagship of this house) , no ""arroz con leche"" , the sardines with ""costra"" got no ""costra"" , the squid was salted in excess . Isabel is really funny and makes you feel like beeing eating in your mother' s house ... but her show is not worth the 42‚Ç¨ we paid for a really regular dinner .",14-Oct-13
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,We went to the restaurant our first night in Madrid and we tried the menu. We had a variety of different dishes which all of them were delicious. We stayed almost a week in Madrid and during this time we had the opportunity to try several other restaurant. None of them was so good. This is the reason that we select the Algarab√≠a for our last night dinner in Madrid. We now tried the a la cart experience. All the propositions were great and we enjoyed them. It is sure that Algarab√≠a is one of the best places in Madrid to eat. Don't miss it!,30-Aug-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Staying in Madrid, I wanted to have as much Spanish-style food as possible and I'm so glad my twin sister and I made this our final night/goodbye Madrid dinner. Part of the attraction was that it looked adorable (and it was), was run by sisters and the food was from a different region of Spain. Isabel, who took our order was so honest about plate sizes considering we could have easily just ordered 2 of each dish, but she would say one plate was enough. My favorites were the octopus salad and the calamari stew-- I wish I could go back and eat them again. The house wine was soooo good and we were given several appetizers. The chef, Pilar, came out and talked with everyone. My sister and I had a long conversation with Pilar and Isabel later in the evening and were the last to leave the restaurant! They were so fun, inviting, and really interested in who we were and why we were visiting; it felt like we had been friends forever. I couldn't believe the bill when we left...charmingly handwritten... but the price, so much food plus dessert for around 100 Euros.",23-Aug-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,1,Negative,"We made an online reservation (which, supposedly, works with their system to validate availability and so on) and then they cancelled it almost immediately and when we called they told us that ""it's a small place"" as explanation for not being able to host us (reservation was for 6 people!!). I'd recommend them to figure out a way to manage their reservation system so when customers do a reservation, they can honor it properly.",20-Aug-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Excellent food and service.  The owner/ chef has a great philosophy towards food , resulting in  a menu that reflects the best of modern Spanish cooking.  I would expect this to get a Michelin star in the near future.",19-Sep-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,Due to the popularity of this restaurant booking in advance is needed. The restaurant has a size that brings the right atmosphere for a romantic dinner. The menu is short but consistent and solid in how the dishes are executed. Recommendation goes for the caneloni and the roasted chicken. The ratio quality/price is optimum.,10-Sep-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Four of us ate at this lovely Bistrot on Saturday night September 2, 2017.  We were lucky enough to get a reservation, I highly recommend calling ahead. The staff is fantastic at describing every dish they offer as well as having extensive knowledge of the wines they sell by the bottle or the glass. The food is so fresh and very simply but elegantly prepared, to let the true flavors shine thru! We all highly recommend this restaurant, I'm sad we ate there our last night in Madrid, we would have loved to have another meal there.",6-Sep-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia lives up to its reviews. The most welcoming, friendly, enjoyable restaurant experience we have ever had.  The food is very good.  The sisters provide a genuine warmth, care and pride in what they do.",10-Feb-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"This is the kind of place you always want to go back to. Not only is the food excellent, but Pilar and Isabel make you feel at home, they are also a great source of information for travelers.",4-Feb-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"On a rainy night in Madrid we sought a restaurant near our hotel to avoid getting too wet wandering around and studying menus at front doors and as a result found ourselves in Algarabia on recommendations made here. From such practicalities are dreams made. Warmly greeted, we were given a thorough run through the menu before being served a wonderful meal, a cracking bottle of Crianza, and enjoying some of the best customer service we've ever experienced. From start to finish we were made to feel both welcome and at home in this cosy, quirky setting just off the Opera, and I couldn't recommend Algarabia too highly. I've been to many restaurants on my travels over the years, and I can honestly say that this was an exceptionally pleasant experience. We were tempted to order a second bottle of wine so we could linger another while (yep, we're Irish), but failing to do so is my only regret when I reflect on our meal at Algarabia. Every best wish to the two wonderful ladies who make this restaurant a true labour of love and a diner's delight. Oh, and I think I can still taste the glorious pate. Hmmm!",21-Jan-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We first tripped over Algarabia last year when my wife and I were out on our first date in looong time and our first choice around the corner was closed. We have since been back half-a-dozen times. The sister-owners provide the most welcoming experience and keen desire to have their guests experience truly authentic Riojana cuisine (from the Rioja region). The menu has a little bit for everyone and is adapted to the season's offerings. I'm not a big fan of the overrated Spanish croqueta, but theirs are a must for any table. Isabel works the floor while her sister Pilar slaves away in the kitchen. Together they are a formidable fountain of information for travellers. We keep going back for their company and for the menu! Well deserved and consistent ranking in the top-15 restaurants in Madrid.",3-Jan-14
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Small and charming restaurant.  The chef explained the menu.  When selecting a wine he recommended we try a sample of two different wines before deciding which one we wanted. The service is excellent.  The artichokes are superb.  Need to make reservations.,19-Mar-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Great place with different meals at a such a good price. Salmon and Canelloni were amazing. Nice different wines as well at a such a good prices.,17-Mar-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A five minute walk from the Prado, Moratin Vinoteca is small, quirky, and popular with Madrilenos. The chef/owner explained the menu, visited again during the meal, charmed us all. The food is sophisticated, extremely tasty, and, on top of it all, amazingly reasonable in price. Reservations are essential.",13-Mar-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Algarabia is a MUST when you are in Madrid!! The two lovely sisters, Pilar and Isabel are delightful and very accommodating to their guests. Pilar is the chef and Isabel is the hostess. The meal is served on individual plates although it is very family centered. Our family had the asparagus with the shrimp croquettes. The sauce was to die for with the asparagus. Our next course was a salad with corvina fish which was followed by a tender steak with caramelized onions. The dessert was heavenly. It was apples with a toffee whipped cream and a chocolate torte with dried raspberry drizzle. The atmosphere is cozy and the restaurant, which has been in business for 22 years, is extremely comfortable. Book your table in advance!! We will definitely return on our next trip to Madrid. We highly recommend this little spot...all 13 of us do!! ",27-Oct-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,4,Positive,While this will not be to everyone's taste I would recommend a visit. This small (about 22 covers) restaurant is run by two sisters. One covers the front of house and the other cooks. The room is like their personal dining room and the cooking is good quality home cooking from the rioja region. A 'tasting' menu is ‚Ç¨36 and with water and a couple of glasses of wine it works out at ‚Ç¨47.  The food is good and the service friendly and very good. There are restaurants serving better food in Madrid. There are certainly grander and/or more expensive restaurants but few will offer a similar experience.It is certainly worth going.,22-Oct-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Sisters Isabel and Pilar run this restaurant that looks like it could have been a home converted to a dining venue. It is small so you may need reservations, especially if there is a theater event nearby. Isabel runs the front while Pilar works the magic in the kitchen. We had the pleasure of meeting these two lovely ladies and they are truly passionate about guest experience. We felt right at home and had great service since we were one of two parties dining at that time. They are so gracious! The food was amazing. It is a marriage of exceptional flavor and home-cooked goodness that made it so memorable. I don't think you can go wrong with any menu selection, but I loved the oxtail, sardines, and of course, the dessert. If ever in Madrid again, we will be back.",16-Oct-17

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Sometimes when a restaurant says it is giving an new interpretation of a classic cuisine, it is hit or miss. This great and unpretentious spot was a hit on everything! The marinated tomato appetizer stuffed with guacamole was really delicious and unexpected, the octopus was one of the best things i‚Äôve ever eaten, and the steak was terrific.  As others have said, the cheesecake was unique, somehow creamy and light at the same time, and absolutely fabulous.  With all this, the staff was very friendly and passionate about Galacian food and culture. We enjoyed talking to them. All that and pretty reasonable on the prices! I would fly back to Madrid just to eat here again!",24-May-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"One of those hidden gems you most likely would never find if it wasn‚Äôt for recommendations.  We had a wonderful food experience with so much good food and so many tastes.  The waiter - who was very friendly and spoke very good English - came with a suggestion for a sharing menu that just blew our mind.  The interior is simple, yet cozy - the food and service is all you take notice of.  Book a table in advance - online booking possible - and enjoy a great evening. ",16-Apr-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Lots of pride and care, attention to detail and commitment to excellence are evident at this small standout establishment. The decor is stylish while comfortable - like dining in someone‚Äôs elegant home library. We were the first to dine that evening which allowed the staff more time to explain the dishes and wines on offer, but even as it got busier with upscale locals the staff made everyone feel at home. We were fortunate this is tomato season and they source theirs from one of the best producers, the way beefsteak tomatoes were meant to taste! We also had a delicate delicious leeks dish and seafood to share for our main course. The key is the quality of the food and letting that come through as opposed to ‚Äúover cooking‚Äù just to show off. We recommend it highly and will gladly return.",22-Jul-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A very cozy place which near by the Prado museum, also with very delicious cuisines and very nice staff.",20-Apr-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,1,Negative,"We had lunch at El Gordo on the last day of four truly wonderful weeks in Spain and Portugal.  A pleasant environment and nice enough food were spoiled by the most astonishing rudeness of the staff - we were not sure what we had done to offend ... or if this was the regular standard of service. There were plenty of staff on hand, but difficult to get anyone's attention, and their manner came across as pretentious, rude, and cold - very different from what we had encountered elsewhere in Spain and Portugal. It seemed to us that we were not welcome in this restaurant.  In addition, a small aperitif, which we did not order, was delivered to the table at the same time as the food we had ordered. We were charged for the aperitif. This is a low tourist rip off more usually perpetrated by the less salubrious type of establishment. Very poor form for such an up market type of restaurant in the most popular shopping street in Madrid. The diner has the dilemma of not wanting to further spoil the experience by having an argument over a few euros, and not wanting to be difficult as you don't want to be a bad ambassador for other travellers.  We have recommended many many restaurants to fellow travellers vis TripAdvisor, but we would not recommend this one. There are so many better places to choose from, and we would highly recommend the La Latina area instead, and in particular, La Taberna Errante - sensational!",27-Oct-17

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"My nephew and I happened at the restaurant just as it opened for dinner and we secured two seats at the bar. We shared the Spanish omelette, the octopus, and the hake. The octopus was by far the best I've had. Everything had wonderful flavors, portions were designed for sharing. We were full after three but had to get the cheesecake everyone was raving about in the reviews. It was so creamy and delicious. Must have! The staff was delightful. Attentive but allowed us to enjoy our meal. They brought the plates one at a time which helped us really savor each dish.  But they do book up quickly so secure a spot!",18-May-19
Restaurante_Morgana,4,Positive,"Once you‚Äôve roved around eating tapas, to sit and be served different takes on Galician staples is a refreshing change.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We asked our tour guide to suggest a small, friendly restaurant where locals go. She suggested we be there at the opening time of 8 PM & we should be able to get in. The owner said they were booked for the evening BUT he had another location just 3 doors down which had the same menu. He had an associate walk us to the other location & told us the owner would be by to explain the menu. My wife had the cod, my friend had the mackerel and his wife and I had the pork and pasta dish. We asked the owner to match the wines and we were given tastes of 2 wines each of whites & reds to make our choice. Wow, does this restaurant know how to make a meal & service their clients. Next time we'll make a reservation. We did luck out. ",25-Oct-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We visited Moratin twice while in Madrid. This was a return visit to Madrid and Moratin. Everything was outstanding. Marcos explaied all the dishes and took the time to talk with us. This restaurant is a gem. You must go!! But, MAKE A RESERVATION. You do not want to miss the experience. Leeks in romesco sauce, fig tartin, tomatoes like nothing we have ever tasted. Pulpo so tender and flavorful .Truly incredible mackeral. We visited Marcos for dinner and lunch.

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"As previous reviews stated, because of limited space at 36, Chef personally escorted us 4 doors down to his 40 location and made a point to direct the staff that we were here as preferred customers and did they deliver in every way. Both spaces may share the same kitchen because I could not expect the original 40 to surpass the food, ambiance and service we received. The simplicity of the presentations only added to the sheer elation when tasting each and every bite. Truly a must visit for dinner or lunch.",15-Oct-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"This small restaurant bar in Chueca has delicious and interesting Spanish fusion food cooked by their inventive Galician chef. Sitting at the bar we had creamy vegetarian croquettes, mussels in curry sauce, tuna pie, and octopus on mashed spicy potatoes. The staff was fun, helpful, and very efficient. The cheesecake covered with strawberry sauce was The best ever. The Spanish wine and beer were good too.",8-Apr-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"My wife and I just finished a wonderful lunch here. The restaurant is very small; reservations would seem essentially. We had a remarkably patient and friendly waiter who explained the inventive fusion dishes to us (Galician with a touch of Asian). Both starters (tuna/pork lettuce roll and clams in a light garlic, flavorful sauce) and both mains (hake and an amazing oxtail cannelloni) were delicious. We enjoyed an excellent Spanish white wine (aptly named ""Immortal""). Prices were very reasonable, especially considering the very high quality of the food and service. We will definitely return next time we have the good fortune to visit beautiful Madrid.",6-Apr-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We went here based on a recommendation from a local friend and had an incredible meal. All ingredients were market fresh and sourced the same day. The chef came out and explained all of the dishes on that day‚Äôs menu, each of which was innovative and tempting. We put ourselves in his hands and were not disappointed. Perfectly cooked fish, exquisite vegetables, delicate but very flavorful spices, all paired with a variety of wonderful Spanish wines from their extensive wine list. And when the bill came it was very reasonable for what could easily have been a Michelin-starred lunch. Do not miss this place!",5-Jul-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,Just our type of restaurant. We had made a booking but all was quiet when we arrived as it was early evening. We were given a lovely table by the window. The food was delicious and the service excellent. Highly recommended.,30-Jun-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Casual atmosphere in a very convenient location. Super friendly staff. Extremely knowledgeable about wine so if that is your interest, this is certainly a good bet. It is not a large restaurant, so reservations might be a good idea as it seems to be very popular. The food is outstanding with a lot of fish and other Spanish specialties. They have an extensive wine list and will be pleased to help you with appropriate choices based on what you choose to eat.",27-Jun-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Behind the Westin Palace on a simple cobblestone road is this bistro. Small, personal and delicious! They take great pride in their wine offerings to pair with your menu choices. Serving sizes are reasonable - a welcome relief from the overly generous servings in many other places. Both fish and meat entrees were nicely prepared and presented. Starters were varied, but the special artichoke starter that evening was to die for.  A great spot out of the hustle and bustle, especially when you are jet lagged!",25-May-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The Vinoteca was full so we went to Moratin 40, which has the same menu. Everything was fresh and delicious. We had asparagus, salmon, the canneloni and fish special of the day. Quite reasonably priced. Definitely recommend.",25-May-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This restaurant is part of the main Moratin at 36, which is down the street! It was, by far, the best dinner we had in Madrid during our visit! The restaurant is a lovely small, and tastefully decorated . The staff were very friendly and spoke good English to us which was very nice as our Spanish is not great, unfortunately. They were very knowledgeable of the food and wines and made good recommendations to us. We particularly liked that some of the plates were small, so easy to share between the 2 of us! The food was superb. Fresh and extremely tasty! The young gentleman waiter who looked after our wine was very attentive and knew at just the right time to be at the table. It was an excellent evening for us and would highly recommend this restaurant. The food was outstanding!",21-May-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Please reserve because you don‚Äôt want to miss this one! Small venue, small menu but out of the menu you will probably have the best dishes (well, we had anyway). All dishes were very good wit superior ingredients and skilled cooking. I loved the alcachofas and the bacalao confitado. The white wine (Trico - Rias Baixas) was very tasty and with ‚Ç¨26 cheap for its quality. The overall bill was ok, value for money. Recommended, but you certainly understood that.",13-Apr-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Based on a Culture Trip review, we dined at Moratin on a weekday lunch. We didn‚Äôt have a booking but arrived at 1345 when only one table was filled. Within the next half an hour, it filled up mainly with locals.  Service was efficient and friendly. The menu wasn‚Äôt long but had some specials. We tried an artichoke special as well as shared the sea bass and a cod special. We also were served a starter on potatoes. The food was very fresh especially the fish which was excellent.  We didn‚Äôt have any drinks other than bottled water. Our meal overall was about E50 which we thought was pretty good for the quality of the food. A great restaurant to visit. ",26-Mar-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,"This week I visited several restaurants in Madrid including Casa Lucio, Amazonico, Makkila, Streetxo, and El Gordo. The last ond was the only one which I went without a previous recommendation. However, El Gordo turned out to be the best gastronomic experience I had in Madrid. I ordered the Confit and magret de pato and the tartar de atun rojo eith a bottle of the recommended red wine ""Briego"". Price tag was absolutely fair, great value for money. I will recommend El Gordo to all my friends visiting Madrid.",13-Oct-17
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,1,Negative,"Had a reservation at 11 pm , got there 11:10 amd basically were quick out of the place, very disrespectful and no regards for costumers. Spain has so many good restaurants that you don't t need this aggravation go somewhere else.",13-Jul-17
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,"I came here with colleagues from our Madrid office and they chose a selection of tapas to share as a starter. All superb from the delicate artichoke to the creamy croquettas, to the juicy prawns. The octopus and mashed potato main course was beautifully presented, tender and rather garlicky. We shared puddings too. My favourite was the banoffee but the melting hot chocolate puddling came a close and excellent second. The surroundings are traditional enough, service efficient and quite formal. Recommended. Wines also fine.",25-May-17
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The staff was very friendly toward us and really made us feel like we were not tourists. The food was very good.

Sometimes, when you travel, you just want to unwind and this restaurant definitely provided us that opportunity.",17-Apr-17
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,4,Positive,Went for a business dinner and the menu had a broad range of choices. Restaurant has lots of little rooms off the main area which made it perfect for business conversation,28-Jan-17

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Morgana is a Galician restaurant. For most people (me included) that will probably mean very little, but this is regional Spanish food well worth experimenting with. Galicia is NW Spain, and Morgana makes the most of Galicia‚Äôs coast and seafood, as well as its agricultural heartland. Dishes are for sharing, so you can try a range of flavours. We were only two, but tomatoes with a guacamole-inspired filling gave us an inkling of things to come, and subsequent highlights included parcels of beef and goats cheese, followed by chargrilled octopus. Outstanding, and topped off by one of the best cheesecakes we‚Äôve ever had. Highly recommend! ",10-May-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Believe all the good reviews you have read about this place. They are true. The food was original, tasty, and all that you would expect from a top rated restaurant. Don‚Äôt hesitate to give it a try.",7-May-19

All dishes we tried were excellent but special mention for the pork knuckle noodles which are brilliant! Service is very good and quick and the guys are happy to help with any questions you have regarding the menu. 100% recommended.,3-May-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"You must visit this restaurant if you come to Madrid. The food and the staff are excellent, but under no circumstances share the cheesecake. I can honestly say the cheesecake is the best I have ever tasted and trust me I have eaten a lot of cheesecake in my time.",22-Apr-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We were recommended this restaurant by our Airbnb host. I emailed and booked from Australia. When we arrived, the owner and chef, Marcos greeted us like a part of the family! With our request, Marcos selected our dishes and matching wines. Their entire meal was exquisite. Home grown, fresh I season produce cooked and served by the owner. Highly recommended. ",14-Sep-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Was walking in the neighborhood where I am currently staying and noticed Morganas . Unfortunately it was closed and gave me time to research the reviews on my down time. Heard great things so I decided to go there last night with my wife. I didn‚Äôt make reservations and arrived around 0930pm and luckily there was a table available. Staff warmly greeted us and sat us in the back of the restaurant. This restaurant is fairly small so would recommend making a reservation as it filled up to capacity while we were eating. As mentioned from previous reviews the food has a Gallegean/Asian infused food per our waiter. I ordered a local craft beer from Northern Spain (awesome ) and we ordered a few appetizers. The stuffed tomato was delicious . They served it with the skinned peeled off and stuffed with an assorted mix of avocado and other greens . I can only describe it as if you love tomato‚Äôs get it you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The other appetizer which were the clams were flavorful as well. I wanted to grab mussels however we ate that previously. Lastly, we ordered the octopus dish which had so many good flavors with a hint of spice and the shredded beef dish inside of some light dough and cheese sauce. Great. Overall my experience here was great and I would definitely come back here again in the future . I apologize for not remembering the server but him and the bartender were very knowledgeable laid back and cool.  PS. Unlike most other countries gratuity isn‚Äôt included on the check so please look out for the waiters . ",26-Feb-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"We enjoyed Morgana sufficiently that we ate here twice in our 6 day stay. The team are friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is great in this compact space. The food is Galician with a twist. The menu is limited because the food is fresh and we enjoyed everything we ate.  Good food, good wine, good service and good value for money .. a great bistro!",20-Feb-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,3,Negative,"This is a small and charming restaurant in an old building with exposed timber beams and vaulted ceilings. The staff could not be more courteous and the restaurant held much promise for a delightful evening. However, my meal was sadly unsatisfying, with my main regret that the food was very bland. The first course was roasted potatoes served with an abundance of paprika and a dish of artichoke hearts (that evening‚Äôs special), also with much paprika. The artichokes were overcooked and flavorless. Other than the paprika, they were not seasoned. The main course (also a special) was mackerel. The quality and freshness of the filets was very good, but again, the fish lacked flavor, as though they had been boiled or steamed. Even some salt would have improved it.  It was not easy to get a reservation and again, the staff was attentive and as friendly as could be, but with so many good restaurants in Madrid, I won‚Äôt return.",19-May-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This is an intimate restaurant with welcoming, knowledgeable staff. The menu is small but innovative and everything is worth a try. The baby artichokes, eaten whole in a single delicate bite, were awe inspiring as was the slow cooked leek confit. Our table also ordered the mackerel special, the salmon and the sea bass. Each was amazing in taste and beautifully presented. The menu skews towards fish with some other options available. We ordered all four of the proffered desserts which turned out to be too much food, although each was delicious.  The pacing was perfect, the wine suggestions spot on and overall ambience serene. It was even quiet enough to hold a conversation. The prices were more than reasonable for the quality of the food. Reservations are a must.  In a week of fine dining in Madrid Moratin was a highlight. ",10-May-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,"Visited the restaurant for the first time and in view of outstanding reviews. Indeed the wine list is very, very good, with many whites, reds, sparkling, Spanish and international ones, with a fair mark up.. The ambiance is quite casual, and reservations needed. The service excellen:, the Chef coming to the table, to explain the different dishes and offering advice as to the wines. The steak tartare, very good as well as the Octopus. Canelones with veal average.",30-Apr-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The food was great, I guess you can try anything there and will not be disappointed. I'd like to especially thank the restaurant for service: it was very prompt and helpful but in no way intrusive and we had a very pleasant and romantic evening there.",19-Mar-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I‚Äôve literally just left here and I have had the most wonderful time, the people are just great, knowledgeable and really helpful in choice of food and wine without any pretentiousness. The food was stunning, baby artichokes, leeks, mackerel and then cannelloni all just great. A real gem of a restaurant and a team of people that made us so welcome, thank you",9-Mar-19
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Like I said, we dined there on two different occasions within five days. Moratin was recommended by our hotel concierge on our second day. We had not made prior reservations, but thanks to the hotel ME Reina Victoria, got us a table. It was nice that the restaurant was within a nice walking distance from our hotel as well.  On our first night, we arrived early and were seated at a nice table for two. We were greeted warmly and treated like VIP's throughout the evening. I must say that this bisro/vinoteca is very intimate and we found it charming. There are not that many tables, but we didn't ever feel rushed or crowded.  We ordered for our first dinner the free range chicken in an albarino sauce with potatoes as well as I ordered the ""dish of the day"", along with the ""soup of the day"" (I believe it was a tomato). Of course, we also ordered some really great wine by the glass. If I recall correctly, our server (could have been owner) indicated he usually sells it by the bottle. If you're lucky and it's in stock, you must try the Toro San Roman 2015 red wine, particularly if you enjoy a bold, dry red wine. I must also say the bread and sides were excellent as well. This is not fancy food, but just great comfort food. We also shared a wonderful plate of grilled vegetables, glass of champagne. On our last night five nights later, we were just so tired that we cancelled reservations at another restaurant called Arrayan and booked Moratin again. Nothing against Arrayan but it was just too far away for us and we were very tired. We definitely would rebook at Arrayan upon our next trip.. Anyway, back to Moratin. This time, we had some more great wine (Toro again and another wine), salmon with pickled vegetables, the same chicken we had our first night, etc. Everything was just as great as our first dining experience there.  Oh, and we would say that it was perhaps one of the best values for the money during our entire Spain/Portugal trip. Our total bill each night ranged between 64 and 74 euros (before gratuity). We would definitely go back. We highly recommend this restaurant. Before or after dinner, please give yourself time to dawdle down several of the streets between Santa Ana Plaza and Moratin. They are narrow, full of different types of shops, and made for pedestrians.",26-Feb-19
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,"Located in one of the nicest areas in Madrid, El Gordo offers absolutely delicious food and great service. Everything I tried was exquisite: especially the cannelloni, I'd say that's their specialty. The tomato tartare with creamy Gorgonzola cheese sauce on top was pretty incredible too. It's sort of upscale, so I wouldn't pick this place if you're on a budget. You can easily have a three course meal and wine for about 45-50‚Ç¨ per person.  There are other nice bars around to go have a drink after dinner, so it's a good option for a fancy night out. Enjoy!",8-Oct-16
El_Gordo_de_Velazquez,5,Positive,"If you are looking for a place where you can just relax, enjoy the moment, talk and have a good dinner, this is definitely a place to go. The service is great and the food was very nice. I went there with 20+ and we really enjoyed it. ",30-Sep-16

Restaurante_Morgana,4,Positive,"If you are tired of crowded places this is where you have yo go. Appetizer are not their best, a bit too salty in my opinion but main dishes are incredibly good, ingredients are fresh and you can see they care a lot about.

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"In the middle of August, it was so hot outside and we looked for a nearby restaurant which was closed (despite TripAdvisor's advice). So I opened the app and saw Morgana very near... As we stepped in, my colleague said ""let's turn back, it's empty"" but the restaurant's good rating kept us inside. We were welcomed by Augustus (hope I didn't forget his name), one of the owners, who gave us his recommendations and some background. -- The food was just excellent: simple but rich, fits the time and place and just great: 1. Empanadas for start with another fusion dish made of tuna, mint Avocado and more wrapped in lettuce leaf - just awesome 2. one main dish was a slow cooked veal cheek very rich in flavour and the other was a steak, superb cut served as cut pieces. A very tasty draught beer accompanied the lunch. 54 Euros for such a meal - excellent value for money, and great taste.  I will be back!",22-Aug-17

The staff are extremely professional and welcoming and I immediately had a good feeling the minute I walked through the door. After trying the food I had to ask about the chef (Miguel) who is clearly a very talented individual serving a unique twist on the traditional Galician food! I strongly recommend you go and try this place out I will definitely be returning. Not to mention the high quality cocktails, what a fabulous combination of flavours absolutely to die for!! Thank you for such a lovely evening! X",13-Jul-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A very small (30 seats) restaurant. The chef/owner greeted you at the door and seated you. He explained the menu, the ingredients, and the preparation. Dinner consisted of leeks with romanescu (?) sauce, cod (prepared sous vide), mackerel (prepared sous vide), porcini mushroom, tarte tartin, and ricotta cheesecake with some of the dishes split between us. We left the wine-by-the-glass selection to the chef/owner; sherry to start, white with the fish, red with the mushrooms. Dinner took 3 1/2 hours, but was well worth the time spent.",24-Jun-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Had a terrific lunch here. Broad choice of dishes and a delicious octopus. But the standout was the highly knowledgeable waiting staff - both about the preparation of the food and the pairing with red and white wines. Most informative and a great way of tasting ""off the beaten track"" Spanish wines. I had a cauliflower dish for starter and the veal cheek canelloni, then we all shared a violet ice cream dessert. Wow, just so nice.",18-Jun-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"I'm sure there is a reason that this restaurant has no Michelin Star, but I don't know what it is. In my humble opinion it rates at least a 2 star. It is a small restaurant and reservations are mandatory. The Chef was very engaging and it was very clear that he has a passion for local food, cooking, wine and generally being a great person. I was there with my wife and 2 friends while visiting Madrid. Not being familiar with the wine selection, I asked if he would recommend. We settled on a pairing of wine and dishes and there was no disappointment. The dishes were simple but full of flavor. We shared Leeks (I never thought I'd praise leeks!), porcini mushrooms in a sauce, cod and veal cheek. Absolutely amazing. My compliments to the chef!",15-Jun-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"A very hospitable restaurant with an exquisite ambience. It's like eating at a friends house. Wines selection is great featuring a very many Spanish grapes. Try the dry sherry. Octopus here was perfect being a slightly al dente texture. Fish specials of cod and another of mackerels were both tasty. The ""braised"" leek offered an unusual preparation. Highly recommended. ",28-May-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"It's no surprise that Moratin is ranked as number 8 restaurant in Madrid ! I have been very lucky to dine here on a few occasions, and every time food, wine, service has been amazing. It's a small restaurant and therefore it's a good idea to book in advance as the place is very popular with locals and travellers alike. As soon as you step in this restaurant you are greeted by very polite and friendly staff, who are very enthusiastic to explain what's on the menu. The way the leeks are cooked and presented is sublime! Delicious potatoes sprinkled with paprika is presented at the table soon enough, which is complimentary. I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything you order... however, the cod dish, veal cannelloni, artichokes , delicate mushroom stew really stood out for me. A worthwhile visit when in Madrid !",18-May-17

Restaurante_Morgana,4,Positive,"I was alone.  At my entrance the waiter said to me that there was no place for me, because I didn't have reservation and he offered to me to eat at the bar. Unfortunately the couple entered after me asked the same to an other waiter and, without reservation, they got a table for them. I made my grievances to the second waiter and he, very embarrassed, found a table for me as well. I was tempted to go away, but I was hungry, and I sat. In Italy we should comment that with a word: ""CAFONI"". Luckily, Catarina, with her perfect English, attended to me, and the atmosphere changed completely. She drove me to discover the tastes and the flavours of comida gallega revisited in a modern way. I'm Italian, from South Italy. And I traveled all around the world. Few person in the world could understand a good food better than me. If I say That it was was great, it was Definitely great! From empanadas, to tortilla, passing by guacamole and fish. Definitely great. Normally I don't take dessert, but Catarina ""forced"" me to taste their cheesecake. I asked if she puts some strong drug inside. It was simply superb. Of course, if you are alone, don't go there. But if you are in couple, you can go, and ask for Catarina. You won't forget that dinner. Thanks Catarina and, please, teach to your colleague what the good education means. Giuseppe",9-Feb-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"I am still sitting here while I am writing this! Friendly staff, good atmosphere, mixture between locals and tourists. The food is fantastic: so many tastes come together and are causing a sensation and explosion in your mouth. I didn‚Äôt expect this. Pulpo with pumpkin pur√©e and cheese on it, slightly spicy. Just soooo delicious! Good beer and wine as well! The staff is friendly and professional! No cheap place but also not too expensive! I can just recommend the place!",20-Jan-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"I visited this restaurant tonight with a couple of friends and found it to be quite busy and packed. Fortunately the very kind waiter found us a place to sit near the bar and it was nice and comfortable. We ordered the tomato dish, grilled with guacamole, mango and kale. This was their signature dish and it is very safe to say that it is the best tomato I have ever eaten. Please try this if you get the chance.  My friends tried the mussels and pork knuckle and rated those dishes very well too. A special mention regarding the seafood Ceviche which was very delicious and very hearty.  But collectively we believe we have tried our favourite cheesecake of all time, which was delightfully served with a small jar of jam.  Would just like to thank the staff as well as they were fantastic and explained all the dishes to us, were very prompt and were overall very kind to us. Extremely happy with this experience and highly recommend this.  It is very busy so try and get in as soon as you can. We didn't book and found a spot but try to book if that is possible.",14-Jan-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Wow. The tomato dish was an absolutely incredible one which is so flavoursome and rich! I cannot compare any other entree I've had. Secondly the cheesecake was to die for, so soft and melts in your mouth, complimented by a silky smooth jam. On top of that, the service was lovely, our waiter was super helpful for catering to dietary requirements, providing info on how to eat dishes and being a really friendly person! Must-have experience in Madrid! Get in early to make sure you get a seat because it's naturally very busy!",14-Jan-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Very tiny restaurant but with a nice minimalistic cozy design.Incredibly good food, perfectly cooked and beautifully displayed. The staff is friendly and they speak several languages.Absolutely a must if you visit Madrid.",9-Jan-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"But it was deserved. Reserve because it is a small place. Nice modern interior. Not many dishes but well diversified. Very nice white Rias Baixas. Great croquetas, good ramen. My fideua was great. Attentive service. We fully recommend.",4-Mar-18
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,Small but charming rustic restaurant with fantastically creative food! Ate some of the best croquettes and tapas I‚Äôve ever had! Staff was amazing and attentive!,25-Feb-18
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"This place is a bit difficult to find because the name is not lit up, but it's worth searching out. We enjoyed the empanada and the ensaladilla (something Peruvian with chicken and egg.) Our main courses were the merluza (a white fish) and pulpo. Both preparations were interesting, though I thought the pulpo was a bit overcooked. The wine, ‚Ç¨19 ""7 Cupos"" was excellent. We almost didn't go because it's supposed to be ""Spanish-Asian"" fusion, but to us it was more Galician than Asian. Yes, the potatoes that came with one of the main courses were flavored with kim chee (Korean cabbage) but it did not overpower the dish. The cheesecake was okay. We'd go back again in a flash. Do reserve: it's small and rarely has room for walk-ins.",8-Nov-17
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"4 of us enjoyed a lunch at this restaurant last weekend and found everything to be excellent.  The restaurant is extremely busy so booking is essential.  Service is excellent and and the menu choice is just right, with not a huge menu ensuring everything is cooked fresh and to a very high standard. The restaurant specialise in Galician food with quite a number of seafood dishes on order which we found to be excellent.  Definitely worth a try we really enjoyed Morgana.",7-Nov-17
Restaurante_Morgana,4,Positive,Small and cosy restaurant within walking distance from the Gran Via. The restaurant was full within 30 minutes after it opened. Short menu but one can easily find a course. Good and attentive service. The food was good for the price. Would go and visit them again,5-Nov-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"You should book a table to be sure to have a seat in this small and pleasant restaurant. The food menu is short, with a few proposals explained by the friendly waiters, and there is an elaborate wine list where they will give you advice should you need it. You can ask for half-portions, which would count as a starter, or full portion as a main. I really loved the leeks with salsa Romesco - cal√ßot-style. ",25-Feb-16
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We felt very welcomed at Vinoteca Moratin, we quickly realized that we were probably the only tourists in the restaurant. This is definitely a spot where the locals go, and the food was absolutely delicious! The service was highly personalized and we were walked through the entire menu and given recommendations based on our tastes and preferences. ",21-Feb-16
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"My fianc√© booked this place as a surprise and as we walked down the quiet Calle de Moratin, I nearly missed the unassuming restaurant entrance.  We walked in and the chef greeted us at 1:30pm to an empty restaurant with a clean, simple and modern interior. Warm lighting showcased the artwork and bookcases of literature with empty wine bottles dotted around. It felt relaxed and comfortable, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. The menu had no more than a handful of dishes with both English and Spanish descriptions. The chef took time to explain each one to us which was lovely of him. We chose the tomato soup, the octopus, the artichokes, the hake fish and the veal cheek cannelloni. The chef took this into consideration and designed the courses with half and full portions so that we could try everything but not be too full. A refreshing approach as most restaurants just want to charge you maximum price for everything and won't care if you can't finish the food.  He also recommended two glasses of cava to start and let us try them before choosing which one. That was very nice of them. The tomato soup was velvety smooth. The accompanying bread well baked with a crispy crust and soft fluffy filling. The cheese sprinkled on top melted and made the dish very warming and delicious. The octopus was served on a bed of creamy smooth potato mash and drizzled with chorizo oil. Tender and full of flavour it was our favourite dish. The artichokes were served in delicious bite size pieces. Soft and creamy, they were decorated with a well paired salt beef sand that gave a little crunch and texture. Unusual and worth a try. The hake was accompanied by grilled asparagus from Peru. Well cooked and full of flavour it was the best part of the dish. We had a generous portion of fish which was well cut. Sadly it was far too salty and slightly overcooked. This was the only bad thing about the meal. The veal cheek cannelloni had a flavoursome beefy filling which had been booked with wine, mushrooms and onions. The bechamel sauce and pasta was light and just right with the crunchy cheesy crust on top making it taste like a high end Mac n cheese... That was kind of lovely hehe. A good end to the meal, we finished and had to rush off to the Real Madrid game but if we had time we would have stayed for dessert as no doubt it would have been delicious.  As we left, the chef came over to shake our hands and thank us. This attentiveness and genuine friendliness makes us want to return and we definitely will. Thank you and enjoy.",14-Feb-16
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We had lunch at Vinoteca. The restaurant is located on a cute street in a fun neighborhood to stroll. We were greeted by friendly staff and the superb service continued throughout the meal. We enjoyed the leek appetizer, the octopus and the chocolate cake. We would probably skip the steak tartare if we revisited Vinoteca. I would highly recommend this bistro for a Madrid meal.",24-Nov-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This was our favorite restaurant in Madrid - and that's saying a lot. We were able to get in for lunch one day, and promptly made reservations for dinner for the weekend. The service, food, wine - everything, in short - was excellent. High end, but not at all over-the-top expensive, and very nice ambiance. Our dinner experience was just as enjoyable as lunch, and we were able to try other things on the menu. Make a reservation!",23-Nov-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We visited on a Tuesday evening, and were greeted by very friendly and attentive staff. Menu was comparatively small, however the chef personally explained the menu to us in great detail, as well as his food philosophy of using local, in season produce and cooking it very simply to maintain flavours etc... Everything we ate was absolutely delicious and the accompanying wine/beer selection was comprehensive. The atmosphere was warm and relaxed. We would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant (we would recommend that you make a reservation as it was busy) and would certainly return if we ever visit Madrid again! ",13-Nov-15

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"On a work do with 8 friends, had a great experience the previous night at another trip advisor recommended restaurant. Called them at around 8pm on a Saturday evening, begged them to make space for my group of 9, they said if I could get there within an hour they'd sort me out. So glad they did. Felt like I was at my aunt's house, the decor, the care taken into the food, the presentation, the experience.  We didn't just eat dinner; we were educated in the Roja district of Spain's culture and cuisine.  The two ladies there were so sweet and funny. They wrote the menu out for us in English by hand! SERVICE!!!! Our meal including several delicious bottles of wine came to ‚Ç¨312 for 9 people. That's great value for such a tailor made and hand guided dinner. We were genuinely sad to leave and promised to come back one day!  Email addresses noted, recommendations sent out to friends and family.  Pure class, could not recommend higher. ",28-Jun-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"On a short trip to Madrid we decided to have dinner at this restaurant on the basis of the various reviews we had read. It did not disappoint. We exchanged e mails and booked a table for 9pm and whilst we were the first, within 20 minutes the room was full and it would seem that many of those eating were regulars. It is run by 2 sisters only, one in the front with the other in the kitchen and at the end of the meal the kitchen lady came out to talk with everyone.  The food was excellent and the menu quite varied bearing in mind the size of the establishment. For what you are getting the price of a meal for two at Eu 100 was good value. If you are in Madrid please visit this establishment but you will need to book and accept that you will not eat until at least 9.30pm",5-Jun-17

Superb food - really superb - wonderful attentive service and a great experience all round. It's deservedly popular so book if you don't want to miss something special. In 3 weeks of a Spain holiday it was the best food we had. And very reasonably priced. ,19-Oct-17

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This is a cozy place run by a couple of very friendly folks, speak very good English - helpful for non-Spanish speakers. They are very knowledgeable about the wine they stock and offer good recommendations; they are passionate about the items on the menu and give suggestions on what is good and fresh for the day. Reservations are required, call ahead.  The menu itself is small and almost all the items on the menu are good (a welcome break from the places which have menus which stretch 10s of pages). We ordered 5 items and shared. The plates were just the right size and great for sharing. The Octopus is the best I have eaten - juicy and well cooked and not at all spongy. The Leeks, Mushroom and Steak Tartar were very good too. We ended with some Creme Catalana - creamy and yummy. I am definitely coming back for the good food and friendly, personalized service.",23-Sep-15
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Dear all If you are in Madrid and you have time the Morgana is a must. We had such a wonderful meal, starters clams and tuna empenadas, mains beef with potatoes and tortillas with B√©chamele sauce and finally the cheese cake was to die for. The service quality of the waitress was excellent and in addition it is all great value for money.  We are going there again.",5-Dec-18
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,My wife and I had dinner here and were in heaven. I would rate Morgana in my top 3 favorite restaurants globally. The cook/s are geniuses.

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"From the welcome we were given , the service and the food itself nothing could be faulted. We were a large party and the suggestion that we have lots of small courses following each other couldn't have been better. The food was all zinging with flavour - freshly cooked, well priced and nicely served. The ambience of the small restaurant was everything we enjoy and we'd heartily recommend it.",26-Nov-18
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Small, cosy, quaint place you could easily pass by on the street without noticing, but the food is great, as well as the service. It is mostly Galician cuisine, though they have ""modernised' it a bit, it feels inventive without losing its originality. Worth the money. The pulpo here is superb, even simple things as croquetas.",25-Nov-18
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Delicious meal! My wife and I loved the cozy atmosphere. Felt like home! Family run restaurant by two sisters who take care of you the moment you walk in the door. Had the octopus salad, foia and veal stuffed tomato, roasted pork loin with caramelized onions, and a fresh-made pasta with mushrooms and bacon. Each item was fresh and every bite was better thab the next. A hot spot among the locals, so you cant go wrong. Will definitely revist if ever in Madrid again. ",23-Jun-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My wife an I had last week a very enjoyable meal and evening at Algarabia. This place is run by two sisters: one who is a very talented chef and the other one who runs the place pleasently. We were the first to arrive at the restaurant and got full attention from the sister who runs the place. She explaned each item on the menue (she did the same for every customer). Each item we ordered was superb, including the house pate and the house wine. To complete the wonderfull evening, the chef sister came out from the kitchen and went from table to table to talk to each customer. The bill came to nearly 70 euro (including wine), which is not cheap for Madrid, but considering the quality of the food it was more than reasonable.  I recomend Algarabia with no doubt and on my next visit to madrid I would visit there again!!!",19-Jun-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We had a truly wonderful meal at Algarabia, made even more enjoyable by the attention and care given to each guest by the sister who is the hostess, and the other sister who is obviously a very talented chef. The house pate was delicious. We ordered the shrimp croquettes which were perfectly fried with a wonderful creamy consistency , and a delicious salad which we shared. For the main course we ordered the squid stew and the stuffed tomatoes with foie and rice. Dessert was a delish crunchy chocolate 'tart' with blueberries. The meal was not cheap but delicious and interesting, plus we left with a recommendation to visit the La Latina quarter where an outdoor interior design exhibition was taking place on some of the main streets. Its an area which we would not necessarily have visited, but we had a great time wandering around there. I would recommend this restaurant highly for a special meal or celebration.",15-Jun-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"My sister and I loved it. We had the degustation which was great value and was showed a cross between traditional Spanish and modern ideas.

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We are mad about Madrid and never visit without dining with the Ladies from Rioja on our first night. It is a great joy to be greeted with such heartfelt warmth by Isabel and Pilar as our favorite table awaits us. There is always a new dish with ingredients from Rioja to be savored. First course was a wonderful salad of fava beans and artichokes from Rioja and the marvelous white asparagus topped with a poached egg and jamon iberico also from Rioja. Both were beautifully presented and paired wonderfully with the ice cold cava. I seem to always opt for The Rabo de Toro as no one does it like Pilar and my partner had the Chumarro pork, both perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender, and of course a bottle of the excellent David Moreno Rioja bottled especially for Algarabia. We had long journey from Lake Como, and were leaving for La Mancha early next day so did not get to enjoy our usual dessert, cafe and agua ardiente to properly finish our evening in true Rioja style. Nevertheless we had a grand evening with Las Chicas de Rioja and enjoyed meeting their other guests, as they always seem to attract such an eclectic and fascinating clientele. Bravo Chicas! You always make our visit to your beautiful city truly memorable..just step through the purple door and enjoy the magic of a night in Rioja with Pilar and Isabel!!",1-Jun-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,A friend recommended Algarabia to me and I as so happy that I took her advice. When you walk in you feel as if you are entering someones home with tables set up. We took some recommendations from Isabel (one of the sisters who own the restaurant) and were very pleased with everything we received on our plates. Pilar (the other sister) is the Chef and she came out to talk to us after the meal and we took some selfies at the end and we felt like we made some new Madrilenian friends - will certainly visit them again when we come to Madrid again! If you get the escargot -know they are not made the french way. It was a little hard for me to eat.,25-May-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Great menu, great food, prepared with a certain sophisticated simplicity The small, but warm dinning room delivers almost perfect ambiance.

Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"N40¬∞25.047' W3¬∞42.631' Like to eat among TripAdvisor members without local people? This is the place to experience the unique TripAdvisor members‚Äô club restaurant atmosphere, made possible by reserving a table online with the help of TripAdvisor. Geared towards international guests, this restaurant has the menu available in every foreign language and the waiter knows her languages. The menu itself mixes starters and main courses and needs explanation, but you are shielded from the awkward feeling of going local. In line with foreign restaurant policy, you are asked beforehand for any allergies. Very save dining in a nicely decorated small and not so busy restaurant. This two sister restaurant - the second is in the kitchen - offers Spanish and Mediterranean cuisine. We ordered in April 2017 ‚ÄúChumarro"" (lightly braised pork loin) with caramelised onions (‚Ç¨18) and cod (‚Ç¨18). Regarding the presentation of the cod, tomato sauce covering the large piece of cod is always suspicious. Why should any chef conceal the most important ingredient? The cod itself did not excite the taste buds. Well prepared without fine taste. The same for the Chumarro, presented with a small portion of grilled onions. Without asking additional onions were offered. Good anticipation from the sisters, but it did not improve the absent of fine taste.  The wine was a David Moreno, Rioja 2012, selected by the restaurant (‚Ç¨17). It tasted good but not a wine to be remembered. For dessert, we ordered crunchy chocolate and raspberry cake (‚Ç¨7). Very nice chocolate smell. The best dish of the whole diner and the second sister left the kitchen to receive our compliments for her cake. For newbies in international travel, Algarabia Restaurante shields you from going native with hard to decode menus and hand signalling with waiters.

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"While looking for restaurants in Madrid I came across good reviews for Algarabia. We walked in on our first night but the little resturant was full. We made a reservation and finally made it on our last night in Madrid. It's a wonderful cosy place with great food. The white asparagus starter was delicious and the pate they served with bread was very good. I was not very hungry that day as we had eaten a very late lunch. However, my husband did justice to the meal. The pork roast was wonderful. The place is run by two sisters, really warm and friendly and it's like eating at someone's home. Isabel showed us pictures that she clicked when she visited India. She seemed so excited and genuine. They only have a 5-6 tables so make a reservation. It's a must visit if you are in Madrid. It's near the palace. Do work up an appetite and go for some real homemade Rioja cuisine. Maya & George",2-May-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Booked in advance and so pleased we did. Quite a small restaurant, poss seating for 20. Food and service simply outstanding.  Starters ground chorizo with egg. Very tasty and quite filling. I had croquettes which were excellent and indeed a favourite of the chef. Main course of cod for me in a simple but divine sauce. It simply flaked apart. My wife had lightly braised pork which was excellent. One dessert- a simple pastry with custard. Accompanied by a bottle of their own Rioja which was perfect for the job. Served by one sister and cooked for by the other. A pleasure to meet both who could not have made us more welcome.  All for about 95 euros...money well spent.  A must for anyone wanting great food in madrid. ",14-Aug-17

This restaurant is a real gem in Madrid! I was a solo traveler and happened to walk by and popped in for lunch. Since the restaurant was full, they seated me at the bar and I received such great attention from Pablo, one of the three friends that runs the place. I was made to feel welcomed and Pablo, though very busy engaged me, in great conversation. Such a welcoming thing to do for a solo traveler! Oh and the food... wonderful contemporary spins on Galician cuisine! After 2 weeks in Madrid, I was tired of the more traditional Spanish dishes and this was exactly what I was looking for - creativity, great marriage of flavors and beautiful presentation. This is my top recommendation for anyone visiting Madrid. And thank you, Pablo, for making it so memorable.",8-Nov-18

We had roasted quail - legs and Tomato filled with veal and pate: the filling was excellent but would have been better off inside pastry, For main coarse we had Pork fillet with caramellized onion; this was excellent,.Oxtail stew with risotto was excellent. We missed vegetables with our meal. Apple tart was excellent, the custard they offered was tasteless. Very limited choice of wine ; 3 different house Riojas; not inexpensive.",31-May-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,My wife and I had a lovely midweek meal here. It is close to the Opera Metro stop and plaza and on a quiet street but well worth finding. The restaurant specializes in Rioja style food and was among the best things we had in on our week-long trip in Spain. The food was delicious and I had the oxtail which was lovely and unctuous and definitely not fatty in distinction from another reviewers opinion. Our starter were also wonderful (marinated sardines with microgreens and fava bean with sweetbreads). The are two sisters that run the place one being a classically trained chef and the other running the front of the house and you will not find two more delightful people or restaurant.,31-May-14

We arrived way too late after an opera performance, and they stayed with us, the day's last guests until almost 1AM, well after closing time, both friendly and talkative! We will definitely be back! If they recommend you a Rioja wine, don't resist! :)",16-Jul-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"The place is not easy to find, just a blind door in a small street. The two sister running the restaurant are welcoming, speaks French and English. The place was very calm (but there was quite a lot of French and we are quieter at lunch time than Spanish or English people) The restaurant has blind windows(because of plants covering the window), which is surprising. The decoration is nice, with books and photo, painting on the wall. Air conditioning is working and is quiet. The menu offers a lots of variety and with a lot of unusual dishes. The one I choose were very tasty, didn't take desert because I had enough eaten, but the table next to me, French as well, made a warm praise for the deserts! I'll definitely come back this week ! Prices are between 10 and 20‚Ç¨ for all dishes (starter to deserts)",11-Jul-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"These two gorgeous sisters run a beautiful, authentic and Rioja inspired restaurant. My partner and I chose the 6 course degustation, which actually ended up being 7 courses (we got a bonus starter). The food was exquisitely prepared and presented. You could taste that fresh ingredients were used and we got an excellent sense of authentic food from the Rioja region. The hospitality was impeccable, with suggestions for wine matching and the opportunity to meet one of the sisters who is the chef at the end of the meal. We were not hurried or pushed to order anything we did not want and we attended to with absolutely courtesy, kindness and an authenticity. An absolute must if you're visiting Madrid in Spain.",11-Jul-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,A small restaurant where you have the opportunity to chat to the chef who is willing to explain the dishes and give wine recommendations. Delicious food and great service.,17-Sep-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Top restaurant ,  a must visit  for  authentic food and a great but intimate  atmosphere.  This  is real food  with fresh  and quality ingredients.  A great  experience, hopefully to visit again.",9-Sep-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,4,Positive,"Very small restaurant, good food and nice choice of Spanish wines. Staff was very friendly but not very fast. Prices are not the cheapest but fair.",30-Aug-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,We shared three appetizers and each had a main and it was very good. The chef/owner came own to take our orders and was very helpful. He explained the various dishes well. We had the leeks to start which we could do cooked very nicely with an excellent romesco sauce. We then had the salmon and the octopus. Each were excellent. I liked the octopus best but my companions preferred the salmon. For our mains I had the steak tartare spicy. It was very flavourful and the best cow based tartare I've ever had. My parents each had fish (hake and cod) and enjoyed theirs. The hake was quite large. My brother had the veal cheek cannelloni and it was very nice. Rich! Overall great food and excellent service. ,29-Aug-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,3,Negative,"After reading several good reviews on this place, we wanted to have good Spanish food here. The service was alright, and perfect location, but the food was just very average, at best.",13-Aug-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"The guy running this place is a really honest lad. He offers the best possible food at fair prices. The menu is not ample, but this is more than offset by second to none quality. I have been five times to this place and it has always been incredibly good. I would highlight the ""puerros"" and the salmon but everything else is also great: the steak tartar, the poultry, lasagna and so on. Moreover, the owner will help you discover very good wines that are generally unknown in Spain and beyond. I wanted to keep the secret, but it is no use any more, you need to book weeks in advance.",12-Aug-15
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,Do not miss this restaurant. Wonderful food and service. The oxtail is absolutely delicious as is the house wine. The two women who run the restaurant are lovely and so friendly. Best meal we had in Madrid!,10-Jul-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Lovely, quirky restaurant, not far from the palace. It is run by two sisters and they are extremely personable. It is almost like dining in someone's house. We went for the sample menu and it was delicious, we left absolutely stuffed. Will certainly return when we come back to Madrid. ",9-Jul-17
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Our first night in Spain was a truly unique experience with a combination of great food, amazing company and a lot of fun. Isabel and Pilar, the two sisters who run the restaurant, made us feel as visiting a Spanish home where they cook the real traditional food from the Rioja region, more like visiting family than eating out in a restaurant. The food was amazing, we had as appetizer the white asparagus with ib√©rico and egg, absolutely delicious. The cod was excellent and the chocolate dessert a must for chocolate lovers.  After dinner, Pilar and Isabel shared time with the visitors gathering us in spontaneous conversations. We found really nice people dining on the table next to us and chat for long time with good wine, laughs, and new acquaintances. Highly recommended!!",12-Jun-17
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"We enjoyed our lunch very much at Moratin. Although the place was full, the service could not have been more attentive. I often say that in Spain it is easy to find great food at every turn, what is more difficult to find is great service. Moratin does both very well. In addition, they had a very nice wine list. Make reservations ahead of time because the place is small and well liked by regulars.",4-Aug-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Not knowing what to expect we had a fantastic meal in great surroundings, quality food, good atmosphere, except that we eat earlier than Spanish thus a little quiet early on. Value for money with surprising quality of food and service Would recommend you try this wonderful restaurant",15-Jul-15
Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"This was an amazing experience... .we came here for my birthday based on TA reviews and this place impressed even these die-hard foodies. This place really is chef-driven with amazing creative food. We had Pollo de corral, puerros confitado, bacalao confitado and everything was amazing. The chef comes out and takes your order and talks to you.. . .very personal touch. This place does live up to the hype and is best food in Madrid no doubt. Come here but be sure to make reservations as it is small place and fills up quickly!",5-Jul-15
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"We family of 4 have had dinner in Restaurante Morgana last night. Enjoyed the food and service very much. The house wine, an albari√±o, got along very well with the seafood. Try the octopus with cheese and the tortilla. The empanada is also awesome. Thank you team for your great recos, kindness and seamless service. Shame we have had to skip the dessert. Next time!",17-Sep-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and thought we would give this restaurant a try. I am often sceptical about rave reviews but this place really was as good (if not better) than I expected. It is small which makes it feel intimate and the service was excellent. The portion sizes were generous - we had two starters and two main courses between us - the empanada, the tortilla and then the hake and the octopus. It was all delicious and even though we were pretty full, we felt we had to try the cheesecake - worth saving a bit of space for....it was divine! I can honestly say that the tortilla was the best I have tasted -- so was the cheesecake ... and the hake was melt in the mouth. It was all excellent - but book if you decide you want to eat here - you can book online (the restaurant is closed up during the day).",10-Sep-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"It may a Spanish thing but opening at 21:00 for dinner seems a little late to a UK person like me and we spent a couple of hours in the bars outside Chueca Metro waiting for it to open. When it opened we were shown to the back room which seemed a little sparse and crowded. I wanted to order the Galician Seafood Cocktail but they were freshly out of that so I settled for the Galician Mussels. These were huge mussels in a Malaysian curry sauce and a real treat. My wife had the freshly made pie which turned out to be a tuna pie, not something we have had before but very tasty. I had the grilled Octopus for my main and my wife the pork knuckle which was served on a massive bed of noodles in a peanut and teryaki sauce, both were amazing. We we so full we were not able to savour the sweet menu.",10-Sep-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Living in New York for many years, I have never tried a cheesecake like here before.- Curry Mussels - kimchi Croquetas- Rubia Gallega cow steak house All kind of traditional- Fusion dishes with so much style and flavor.100% Recommended",10-Sep-19

Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot,5,Positive,"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children ages 14 and 17) ate lunch here based on the recommendation of tripadvisor. It was fantastic. For starters we had leeks unlike any leeks in red pepper sauce. They were soft and buttery and melted in your mouth. My husband had melon soup with mint which was very refreshing. Other dishes were veal cannelloni, grilled chicken and mackerel. The mackerel was fantastic. Overall a memorable meal.",5-Aug-17
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"Very cool restaurant, with a changing menu with Asian overtones.  Our waiter, Pablo, was incredible, and we had a memorable and reasonably priced meal in the heart of Madrid.",23-Jul-19
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We went with my wife one night, the restaurant was not easy to find, we thought it was closed, but we enter the door opened by one of the owners and we were lucky to find a place without reservation. Both owners were so nice with us that after a fantastic meal we ended all four seated at the table, sharing a bottle of wine they opened for free. I tried ""rabo de toro"", strongly recommend it.",29-May-14
Azotea_Forus_Barcelo,5,Positive,The shots are fantastic and the servers are great. This place definitely deserves 5 stars at minimum.,24-May-19

Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"We had the Pulpo and the Pork (Cordillo), both of which were excellent. Our waiter was also very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.",1-Sep-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"I read a lot of wonderful reviews of this cafe. And this one open early than most other restaurants in Madrid for lunch. So I decided to give it a try. Stuffed tomatoes are surprisly yummy which have layers of taste. Steak portion is huge and good for share. It's not the best quality steak but for that price? I have no complain at all. Optopus is soft and tasty. The sauce match perfectly with optopus, it's much better than the optopus that I had in a 2/3stars Japanese michiellin restaurant in Hong Kong. Fish is good but no surprise. I would recommend you to try another dish. Cheesecake is super yummy and it's a must to order dish . I will be back here if I come to Madrid again. Highly recommend if you want casual, fast and good food. ",17-Aug-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"My husband and I ate here on the fly after a change of plans. We were able to snag the last reservation and get there quickly since it was a four-minute walk from our Airbnb. This was a wonderful, intimate restaurant with delicious food.  Order the mejillones and a bottle of dry white wine -- you can't go wrong with this delicious Thai-influenced starter. We could have ordered about four orders of this and eaten this for our entire meal. Delicious! If you order beef for your meal, be aware there's a tendency to cook it rarer than you might expect. So definitely clarify that before you order! The tables are close together, and we sat next to a really charming, sweet couple who cut off a piece of their cheesecake and gave it to us -- it was out of this world! They also recommended the licor de hierbas after the meal as a digestive liquor. We ordered it, and it was the perfect ending to our meal!",26-Jul-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,Quality will be my key word for Morgana. The food is incredibly tasty and fresh. I would recommend 100% this cozy restaurant in Madrid.,13-Nov-19

We wish we lived in Spain so we could visit more often.",7-Nov-19
Restaurante_Morgana,5,Positive,"We had reservations for a Saturday night at 9. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Wait staff were friendly and helpful. We ordered the octopus, tomatoes, and mussels. All three were fantastic, but the stand out dishes were the tomatoes and mussels, they were exceptional!

The atmosphere is unpretentious and comfortable.The chef and staff are warm and friendly. The food is fresh and beautifully prepared in ways that bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients, rather than trying too hard to impress. The chef made excellent suggestions, including selections from an extensive wine list. Listen to him! He knows! I loved this place. If I go back to Madrid, I will return!",12-Jul-17

We got lucky, were at the door 5 mns before opening time at 8.55pm and were offered to sit at the bar, we didnt mind even with small kids as we really wanted to eat here. I really came for their cheesecake which i only saw a picture of on tripadvisor but i could easily tell it would be delish and indeed it was amazing.

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"Pilar and Isabel are the two sisters that own Algarabia. They treat you as if you were a dinner guest in their home. We had the Chef Tasting menu which started with fresh p√¢t√© and toast, followed by cheese croquettes and baked asparagus wrapped in a thin slice of meat. It was a unique taste in that the asparagus was actually crunchy! Excellent! Our next course was a generous portion of fresh cod baked in a tomato sauce. Very juicy! The main course was four pieces of tender pork loin topped with carmelized onions that gave the meat a slight sweetness. Another winner! All of this was enjoyed with a very nice bottle of Rioja. Get their oldest vintage. It's well worth it! Dessert was a surprise by Pilar, the chef. It was a small cup of apple mousse paired with a flourless chocolate cake that had just a hint of raspberry.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Algarabia, and will definitely return! Be sure to make a reservation because there are only seven tables in the main room and one larger table in the back room. An experience not to be missed!",29-May-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,2,Negative,"My husband and I went out of our way to dine here given the great reviews and we were disappointed. We ordered didn't order starters, just mains (and dessert) and a bottle of wine. I ordered the pasta mushroom, I'd not seen anything like it when it arrived! It was oodles of well-seasoned pasta with a few bits of mushroom. No sauce whatsoever. Husband had the oxtail, he said it was very fatty and not much flavour. We both ordered chocolate cake for dessert, and were served what looked like a tart. The base was over-cooked and was very tough and there was not much in the way of filling.  This restaurant is actually a private home with a 6-8 tables. The chef and waitress are sisters and are actually very lovely people, they clearly enjoy what they do and that's nice. The chef came out to speak to the diners at the end, and she was lovely. We were utterly disappointed with the food, I'm sorry to say. We are not able to reconcile the five-star reviews on TA.",28-May-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"I was in Madrid and did not want to get into a touristic, usual place. Was looking for something really particular and tripadvisor got me into this restaurant. What a choice...! You ring a door bell and it looks you get more into a private house rather than a public place. The ambient is nice, well cared, but not extremely formal, smooth and soft. The cousine is typical from the Rioja region, men√π is not huge but inviting in all selections. Wines offer is even more limited with 3 different vintage on the same Rioja wine, but even the basic one is not bad at all. I would suggest the pork with the onions, really nice! Overall, I can not guarantee it's a place you will return, but for sure, it is one you will never forget.",24-May-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,3,Negative,"My husband and I visited Madrid in celebration of our Ruby Wedding Anniversary. We had found this restaurant on TA and decided to make a visit. We were not disappointed in fact we loved it so much we went back again before we left Madrid.

When we had finished our meal, we were treated to a drink with the other member of this delightful couple of sisters, the chef!! Make sure you not miss this small intimate restaurant, it certainly made our trip to Madrid memorable",18-May-14
Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"We went here following reviews on TA and were not disappointed. A tiny restaurant which seems as though it is in the sisters' front room!

Restaurante_Algarabia,5,Positive,"On a recent trip to Madrid I stayed with friends who have lived in Madrid for over 25 years. They suggested dinner at Algarabia as they have eaten there quite often. I was so pleased by the whole experience that I want to recommend this wonderful restaurant to anyone visiting Madrid. Isabel and Pilar are the chef/owners and they were wonderful hosts. We had not reserved and the restaurant was quite busy, however Isabel was very accommodating and we were soon seated sipping a superb Basque red wine that complimented our meal. Each of the courses were delicious. On Isabel's recommendation we shared the meal family style so I was able to try most of the menu selections. Everything was wonderfully prepared and presented by Pilar. We had the asparagus wrapped in pastry, the stuffed tomatoes, croquetas (the best that I have ever had!) and the pork loin. For dessert the apples and cream made for a delicious finale. At the end of the meal Pilar came out to speak with us and talked about the regional influences she takes in her cooking. Both owners are very gracious and kind.  The setting is intimate and charming and the service and food are equally superb. This was without a doubt the best meal that I had during my trip to Spain. Thank you Isabel and Pilar!",30-Apr-14
